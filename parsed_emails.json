    "date": "Wed, 30 May 2001 08:12:00 -0700 (PDT)",
    "body": "On December 15, 2000, EPSA, ELCON, Enron, Reliant and Dynegy filed a request\nfor FERC to hold a technical conference to focus the industry on\ninterregional coordination as prescribed in the RTO Order 2000 Function 8\nrequirements.  Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway\nwere independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with\nneighboring business practices.\n\nAt the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC\ntechnical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal\nof the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when\nhe instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address\ninterregional coordination.\n\nThe key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's\nactive participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a\nnon-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on\nOASIS Phase II.\n\nBy working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing,\nEnron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS\nPhase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the\nearlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference.\n\nGovt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical\nConference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.\n\nCharles Yeung\nGovt Affairs NA\n713-853-0348",

Items of\ninterest:\n\nThird party studies may be used upon mutual agreement between SPP and\nCustomer; however, SPP is not required to allow a third party contractor in\nany instance that it cannot meet the time frames for study completion.\nThe current queued customer will bear the costs of completing a new study if\nsomeone in the queue before it withdraws.  (Dynegy asked that the withdrawing\ncustomer should pay for any new studies required by others.)\nWhile SPP is required to provide notice if the study will take more than 60\ndays, it is not bound to complete a study in 60 days (if more time is\nreasonably needed.)\nIf transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for the costs\nof upgrades that are needed \"but for\" the interconnection.  However, once\ntransmission is requested, SPP is limited to charging the higher of (i) the\nnetwork upgrade expansion cost or (ii) an embedded cost rate which has the\nexpansion cost rolled-in.  This is similar to pricing on pipelines.\nTypically, Enron would not want to pay for network upgrades (as opposed to\nthe interconnection alone costs) without obtaining the transmission right on\nOASIS.  This order does advance the argument that network upgrades which\nbenefit the system (other customers) should be paid for in rates to all\ncustomers.\n\nLet me know if you would like a copy of the order.",

    "subject": "Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy",
    "date": "Fri, 9 Nov 2001 15:48:54 -0800 (PST)",
    "body": "Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\n--\tThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\n--\tChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\n--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\n--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.",

    "subject": "Re: VEPCO PPA",
    "date": "Thu, 15 Jun 2000 10:41:00 -0700 (PDT)",
    "body": "Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:\nI haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times\nthere are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency\npower to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would\nwant the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to\nreplace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get\nthis agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).\nI would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.\nInterconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting\ntransmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its\nnetwork transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have\nto purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the\nplant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to\nsupply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin\nPresto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's\nnetwork transmission to delivery to third parties.\nIs this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent\nrulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While\nVEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that\nyou do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to\ntransmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only\nway to ensure deliverability to third parties.\n3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an\nincrease.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other\nsources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission\nand subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on\nbest/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase\ndaily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of\nreceipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as\nnon-firm.)\n12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that\nhas not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since\nFERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant\nchanges in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining\ntransmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this\ncontract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price\ncovers that circumstance.\nUnderlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at\nmost any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any\ncurrent transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will\npay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this\ncontract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Chapman\n06/13/2000 06:07 PM\nTo: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:\nSubject: VEPCO PPA\n\nChristi--\n\nThis is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively\nearly draft of the PPA.\n\nI think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and\ndo the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.\nIN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up\nthe regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue\nless contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at\nRockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.\n\nUsing the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their\ngas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas\nfrom the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the\nNCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think\nthat we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply\nworking on some of the siting issues.\n\nThat being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or\nJeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there\nare some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.\n\nThanks.\n\nTom\n---------------------- Forwarded by Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 06:04\nPM ---------------------------\n\n\nLinda J Simmons\n06/13/2000 08:45 AM\nTo: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron, Heather Kroll/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ozzie\nPagan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey M Keenan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:\nSubject: VEPCO PPA\n\n\n----- Forwarded by Linda J Simmons/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 08:44 AM -----\n\n\"Nancy Wodka\" <nwodka@bracepatt.com>\n06/12/2000 04:20 PM\n\nTo: <linda.j.simmons@enron.com>, <lisa.mellencamp@enron.com>\ncc: \"William Frederking\" <wfrederking@bracepatt.com>\nSubject: VEPCO PPA\n\n\nLisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based\non the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did\nencounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are\nnoted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and\nare also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this\ngoes to VEPCO.\n\nCover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be\nENA or a special purpose company?\n\nDefinitions--  We included a defined term \"Emergency Start-Up\" (a start up or\nincrease in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to\ninclude a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.\n\nSection 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy\ncharge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?\n\nSection 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD\nwill be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also,\nit would be best to define \"commencement of construction\" to avoid\ncontroversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a\nplaceholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is\nyour preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific\nremedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that\nmilestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would\nbe a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90\ndays if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the\ncure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?\n\nSection 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under\nthis PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement\nto sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the\nFacility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take\n1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be\npro-rated for the first year?\n\nSection 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of\nAvailability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the\ntotal hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated\nthat the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other\nthan due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled\nmaintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be\navailable.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated\nthat a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why\nwouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we\nincluded language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during\npeak periods.\n\nSection 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of\nEnergy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we\nallow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?\n\nSection 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.\n\nSection 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?\n\nArticle 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not\nhave any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do\nyou want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for\nnow?\n\nSection 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or\nwould you prefer a shorter period?\n\nArticle 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step\nprior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is\n\"baseball\" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's\nposition or the other's.  Is that what you want?\n\nSection 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it\nwill be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not\nrecommend Virginia law for this contract.\n\nExhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please\nsee the bracketed notes therein.\n\nPlease call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.\n\n- VEPPPA.DOC",

Most of my changes\nfocused on the arbitration clause.  Given the nature of this Agreement, we\nshould be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for\nexample, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron\nEnergy Services).  If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we\nmay want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and\nDynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an\nexhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect\nat the time this Netting Agreement is executed.\n\nPlease contact me with any questions or comments you may have.\n\nThanks.\n\nErnie\n\n(See attached file: Enron Master Netting Revised 10-23-01.doc)\n\n\n\n- Netout.doc\n- Enron Master Netting Revised 10-23-01.doc",

This is my suggested approach, which is obviously subject to\nchange per our discussion during the call tomorrow.\n\nI would like to highlight that the draft characterizes the approach as a\n\"circuit breaker\" during periods of highest demand and suggests that this is\ndistinct from notions of market power abuse.  Other entities are arguing\nthat during the highest demand, when it exceeds available supplies, all\nsuppliers have and are \"exercising\" (as distinct from abusing?) market\npower.  The draft attempts to highlight the current regional supply context\ncharacterized by the drought as a rationale for the \"emergency circuit\nbreaker.\"\n\nAs mentioned in Katie Kaplan's email this morning, if your company has a\ndraft of comments, we would appreciate an opportunity to look at them to\navoid substantive conflicts.\n\nI trust this is the right distribution list but I was not able to use the\nlist from this morning's email because of computer problems at my end.

The extent of the\noutages and whether they are anticipated to last the afternoon and into the\nevening will be evaluated on an hourly basis. Conservation is strongly urged\ntoday and could easily make the difference in maintaining operating reserves\nat a level that could lesson or prevent blackouts.\n\nSpecific details will be available at the following media briefings.\n\n\nMedia News Teleconference\n\nTIMES (PST):      10:30 a.m.       2:00 p.m.  6:15 p.m.\nPHONE NUMBER:     800/374-1387\nPASSCODE:         ISO News\n\nMore than 12,000 megawatts of generation remain unavailable in the state\ndue to planned and forced maintenance outages. In addition, half of the\nstate's Qualifying Facilities (QFs) are not operating because of reported\nfinancial concerns, low wind or an inability to purchase natural gas to run\nthe plants. QFs are small independent power generators that include biomass\nplants, wind farms and photovoltaic (solar) projects.\n\nCalifornia ISO anticipates reaching a peak load of 29,952 megawatts this\nevening. Earlier a Stage Two Emergency was extended through midnight\ntonight. Voluntary load interruption programs were activated this morning.\n\nStage Three of the state's Electrical Emergency Plan (EEP) is required when\noperating reserves fall below one-and-a-half percent. The California ISO's\nEEP is part of the state's enhanced reliability standards created by\nlandmark legislation Assembly Bill 1890, which restructured California's\nelectricity industry. California ISO is charged with managing the flow of\nelectricity along the long-distance, high-voltage power lines that make up\nthe bulk of California's transmission system. The not-for-profit\npublic-benefit corporation assumed the responsibility in March, 1998, when\nCalifornia opened its energy markets to competition and the state's\ninvestor-owned utilities turned their private transmission power lines over\nto the California ISO to manage. The mission of the California ISO is to\nsafeguard the reliable delivery of electricity, facilitate markets and\nensure equal access to a 25,526 circuit mile \"electron highway.\" Information\nabout the California ISO control area's electricity supply and the current\ndemand is available on the web at .

The\nAttorney General told the court that both power companies have failed to\nfurnish documents despite being given assurances on the confidentiality of\ntheir sensitive and proprietary information.\n\n\"Reliant's sole basis for refusing to produce confidential information is its\nclaim that the Attorney General may not share such information with other\ngovernmental agencies that the Attorney General may enlist to aid him in his\ninvestigation,\" the Attorney General stated in the complaint. \"The argument\nsimply lacks merit.\"\n\n\"Reliant has sufficient guarantees regarding the confidentiality of its\ninformation,\" the complaint said.  \"The Attorney General has stated that he\nwill not share confidential data with governmental agencies which have acted\nas Reliant's competitors in the market or agencies with whom Reliant is\nnegotiating energy contracts.

He specifically asked about capping the forward\nmarket.  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing\nthat there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24\nmonths) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage\nof their needs from this contract.\nA staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market\n(presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that\ngeneration not be cancelled in California.\nDynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the\nCommission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.  Specifically, what\nis opportunity cost?  As long as the test is not known until after the fact,\nthere will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater\nincentive to sell elsewhere.\nHobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not\neliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be\ntemporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues\nand retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be\nonly for one month).\nMany, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission\nshould not institute penalties only on the load.  They claimed this was\none-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied\nto the supply side as well.  They also argued that the load could not meet\nthe 5% test.\nMassey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's\nencouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their\nauthority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.\nLarcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation\nbefore deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of\ntoday.  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include\nstranded costs.\nThere was almost no support for the single price auction in California.\nThe California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be\nchanged, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.  A\nCourt battle was threatened.\n\n\n\n\nSteven J Kean\n11/13/2000 08:51 AM\n\nTo: Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J\nMara/SFO/EES@EES, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sarah\nNovosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Paul\nKaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT\nSubject: Re: Comments on FERC November 1 order\n\nThere are a few other issues we need to look into:\n\nLarcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the\nprice caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO\n-- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked\nif knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I\nsuspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as\nthe market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this\n\"exemption\" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it\nthrough.  Is EOL or APX an alternative?\nMassey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.\nSpecifically, \"has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market\ndevelopment?\"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we\nshould argue that \"PJMing\" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder\nforward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that\ntake away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about\ncontracting forward.\nWe have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think\nthrough whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take\nthe approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to\nprovide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those\nrequirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as\nmuch as possible).\nFinally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO\nas a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO\nis simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in\nretaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing\ntheir lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices,\nacquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial\nand highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.\n\n\n\nMary Hain@ECT\n11/10/2000 11:13 AM\n\nTo: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron\ncc:\nSubject: Comments on FERC November 1 order\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Hain/HOU/ECT on 11/10/2000 09:20 AM\n---------------------------\n________________________\n\n\nTo: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT, steve.c.hall@enron.com, Richard Sanders,\nSusan J Mara/SFO/EES@EES, Mona L Petrochko/NA/Enron@Enron,\njdasovic@ees.enron.com, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, James D\nSteffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hartsoe@Enron, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON,\nJames E Keller/HOU/EES@EES, Mike D Smith/HOU/EES@EES, Harry\nKingerski/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert\nBadeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Steve\nKean, Richard Shapiro, Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT\ncc: carrrn@bracepatt.com, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com\nFrom: Mary Hain/HOU/ECT\nDate: 11/09/2000 05:19:03 PM\nSubject: Comments on FERC November 1 order\n\nFor purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of\nissues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our\ncomments to FERC.

ROBERT NELSON\" <JRNELSON@LLGM.COM>\n04/18/2001 12:57 PM\n\nTo: Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com\ncc: CEKLUND@LLGM.COM\nSubject: Power Exchange\n\n\nThe Committee interviewed financial advisors yesterday.  The list included\nPriceWaterhouse, KPMG, BDO, Stonefield Josephson and Neilson, Elggren.  The\npreference seemed to be PW, in major part because it was actively involved in\ncreation of the Power Exchange systems.  There was an obvious concern about\nthe potential for conflicts given PW's role for the PGE committee.  In that\nregard, we were told (1) that there is a different standard for accountants\nthan attorneys, (2) that counsel for the PGE committee didn't perceive a\nproblem, (3) that there would be different teams handling each of the cases,\n(4) that it was highly unlikely that there would be any disagreement over the\nunderlying numbers (ie, that PW would at the same time be supporting and\nchallenging numbers in claims litigation).  We've asked PW for assurances\nthat if there is any challenge, it will be available to support the\nparticipants' position.  We're waiting for a response.  For the moment, no\nsecond choice has been identified.\nBefore the interviews, I spoke with Marc Cohen.  He's frustrated with Joe\nEisenberg.  Joe has been slow in generating a stipulation to transfer\nlitigation responsibility to the participants committee.  Consequently, Cohen\nwent ahead and drafted a stipulation himself.  Evidently Eisenberg is about\nto sign off, and the matter will be presented to the court presumably on\nshortened time.  I took the opportunity to urge Cohen to press Eisenberg to\nprepare a liquidating plan.  In that regard, Eisenberg did go to the\ncreditors committee and propose using $4 million of the $20 million of\navailable cash to support a plan.  Not surprisingly, the creditors came back\nasking for $18 million.  Cohen's sense is that there may be a deal in the $10\nmillion range, particularly if we can persuade the trade that the\nparticipants may themselves have a claim against the $20 million.  Cohen is\ngiving thought to how we make that case.  If we can agree on a number, we can\nget rid of the trade creditors, shift responsibility for the wind up to a\nliquidating agent of our choosing and close the bankruptcy case.\nCohen apparently has made no headway in efforts to reconstitute the PGE\ncommittee.  He's concerned that the second largest creditor does not have a\nseat at the table and questions whether the presence of such entities as\nEnron and Dynegy adequately represents the interests of the broad range of\nPower Exchange participants.  Wearing our CPX committee hat and the duty that\ncomes with that, are we comfortable leaving things as they are rather than\nencouraging our counsel to pursue the matter with some formal motion in the\nPGE case?  Unless I hear to the contrary, I'll assume that our position in\nthat regard has not changed and that if there were a committee vote on that\nparticular issue, we'd abstain.\nI see that some efforts may be underway to compel the Power Exchange to\nrelease collateral.  Is that something we'd consider joining?

Please ensure that \"WACM\" is the last PSE on the tag.  This is importan=\nt as it provides proper credit to the Transmission Customer for losses deli=\nvered.\n2.  In the 'Comments' field, please put the words \"WACM Losses\".  If the ta=\ngs are for a real-time transaction from the previous week, please indicate =\nthe date; i.e., \"WACM Losses for MM/DD/YY\".\n3.  Prescheduled transactions require a concurrent tagging of loss energy t=\no WACM.\n4.  Real-time transactions require a return of loss energy to be accomplish=\ned same day, next week, same profile.\n5.  It is allowable to combine losses due in any day/week/month/season on a=\nsingle tag if that is easier for you to do so.  WACM calculates the amount=\nof loss energy due from a Transmission Customer per day based on preschedu=\nled transaction losses due on Day 0, plus real-time transaction losses due =\nfrom day -7.\n\nWe are working with WACM Operations staff to see if, with the new schedulin=\ng software implemented, we will be able to accept real-time transaction los=\ns energy concurrent with the real-time transaction.  If we are able to effe=\nct that change, it will be posted on OASIS and we will get an e-mail off to=\nyou immediately.\n\nIn the meantime, if you have any questions, please give me a call or send a=\nn e-mail.\n\nLynn Richardson\nPublic Utilities Specialist\nRMR\n(970) 461-7440",

We believe the foundation for many of these\nreports is both poor analytical methodology and bad data. To conclude that\nweather-adjusted natural gas demand has fallen by 5 to 10 bcf per day\nimplies a demand deterioration level similar to what we saw in early 2001,\nwhen prices soared to near $10 per mcf. Unlike then, today's fuel-switching\nincentives still favor natural gas. Secondly, there is little economic\nincentive for today's industrial consumers of natural gas to shut down\nplants in an improving economic environment.

    "body": "Here are the FERC presentations.  The first one is Tim's.  It corrects some\ninformation in my presentation.  For example, Tim's presentation corrects the\nhydro generation numbers to reflect the fact that not all hydro capacity\nequates with hydro energy, if there isn't sufficient water to produce it.  My\npresentation includes more verbal explanations.  Cooper and Alan - does any\nof the data in these presentations need to be updated?\n\n\nFrom: Steven J Kean@ENRON on 11/07/2000 08:59 AM CST\nTo: Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard\nShapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J\nMara/SFO/EES@EES, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, David Parquet/SF/ECT@ECT,\nMary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, James D\nSteffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Peggy\nMahoney/HOU/EES@EES\ncc:\nSubject:\n\nI will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.\nThe format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your\nhelp to make sure I have \"Gore-like\" command of the details.  Please help\nwith the following information:\nEnron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any\npresentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we\nhave under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are\ncomfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever\ninformation you have.\nUpdated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information\nwas as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking\nfacilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.\nComparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from\nthe ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would\nbe nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already\napproved.\nCancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel\ncomfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of\nhow price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.\nISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is\nthere another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of\nthe PX report too.\nCEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information:\nproposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to\nexpedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less\nthan 10%)?\nSoft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the \"soft\" nature of\nthe cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it\nto say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting\nrequirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than\napplying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears\nthe market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?\nOffers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus\nany others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market\nwill provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility\n(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.\nHerding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be\ncourageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway\ncredible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else \"squishing\" on the\nprice cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need\nthese guys on board.\nThanks.",

Judge Montali issued his order today granting PG&E's motion (in which\nour Creditors Committee joined), vacating the appointment of the Ratepayers\nCommittee.?\n\nThe Judge ruled that the Bankruptcy Code does not grant the ratepayers\nstanding as they are not creditors of PG&E, and that there is no statutory\nauthority on which an official ratepayers' committee could be based.? The\nState Attorney General is capable of addressing consumers' interests in the\nbankruptcy case.? Individual ratepayers are always free to seek to intervene\nlater on particular issues in which they have an interest.? The Judge made\nclear that \"having an interest in a result (as all ratepayers do) does not\nrise to the level of having a claim as defined by the Bankruptcy Code.\"? He\nnoted that \"the Bankruptcy Code, and the bankruptcy court, were designed to\nresolve debtor-creditor problems; state agencies are where issues such as\nrates for electricity are handled....[T]he estate...should not be burdened\nwith matters likely to be resolved elsewhere.\"?

You told people their opinions were important, and that you understood how they felt. You clearly stated that what happened should not have happened. Despite the fact that you were not part of the collapse, you apologized as part of the management team.\n\nYou spoke positively of the future, of the new company, and of the people that would be at the helm in the new company.\n\nIn todays environment, Leaders need to be seen and heard. I sincerely believe employees want to regain a level of trust in the company and leaders they thought they knew.\n\nI believe you made a positive step in making that happen with your comments today.\n\nAgain, thanks.

Conference on Order 637 including Hourly Firm Service\nJanuary 24, 2000\n\n\nThough the conference was billed as a combo of Order 637 and Hourly Firm=20\nService (FT-H rate schedule), Order 637 issues were not discussed.  Tenness=\nee=20\ndid a recap of where they are in that proceeding and explained how proposed=\n=20\nchanges to daily balancing impact FT-H. =20\n\nBasic Description of FT-H\n\n? The target audience of the FT-H is combined cycle base load generation, n=\not=20\nnecessarily peaker plants, though the service is available to all shippers.=\n=20\n? FT-H will be generally available capacity subject to an NPV open season. =\n=20\nContractual rights assigned to FT-H are firm daily quantities that can be=\n=20\nnominated hourly as 1/18 to 1/4 of the daily quantity. =20\n? FT-H shippers must specify a 12-hour daily service period for MHQ=20\neligibility (i.e., 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and daily receipt quantities hav=\ne=20\ne to match delivery quantities on a contract basis (not necessarily on a fl=\now=20\nbasis). =20\n? Nominations have a one hour start-up and shut-down time. =20\n? Balancing is the same as regular firm with no hourly balancing charges\n? Rates are analogous to storage charges, with three components:=20\ndeliverability rate (hourly, 70%), capacity rate (daily, 30%), commodity=20\ncharge (based on flow).\n\nSummary\n\nWith only lukewarm support of the proposal at the conference, Tennessee wil=\nl=20\ngather and send some clarifying material out to parties, but will also thin=\nk=20\nabout pulling the service at this time.  If they do continue with the FT-H=\n=20\nproposal, the pipeline will file a modified proposal in two weeks with=20\ncomments due in mid-March.  There may be a follow up conference to be=20\nscheduled at a later date.  A FERC order on the filing must be issued by=20\nmid-May.\n\nFERC Staff stated that they prefer to keep Tennessee=01,s order 637 proceed=\ning=20\n(RP00-477) separate from FT-H (RP01-81).  Tennessee met with customers on 6=\n37=20\nissues the following day (Jan. 24th) and will file a letter on their proces=\ns=20\ngoing forward in RP00-477 by January 31st.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAfter Tennessee=01,s explanation of the FT-H service, Staff asked questions=\n=20\nabout the impact of hourly service on other services, and began by asking i=\nf=20\nTennessee could make public any modeling or service studies done to determi=\nne=20\nthe impact of FT-H on other points (Staff noted that this analysis or=20\ntransparent modeling should be filed for transparency).  This opened the=20\ndebate about =01&historical operation,=018 which is the focal point of exis=\nting=20\nshipper concern.  Shippers define historical operation as that they=01,ve=\n=20\nreceived over time; Tennessee maintains that current tariff entitlements as=\n=20\ncontracted define current service, excluding enhanced services that may hav=\ne=20\nbeen offered when available.\n\nLDCs are concerned with losing these =01&enhanced=018 historical services a=\nnd argue=20\nthat their contracts were signed so long ago that many of the services they=\n=20\nuse now were not available or defined then, and some, such as pressure,=20\nwouldn=01,t be acceptable today as written in their contracts.  At the hear=\nt of=20\nthe matter, LDCs have become accustomed to access to more than 1/24 of thei=\nr=20\nMDQ in an hour and do not want their capacity to be defined as such.  Also,=\n=20\nthere is concern over nomination priority using NPV to compete with FT-H. =\n=20\n\nOther LDC concerns: =20\n? Preferences to secondary rights to FT-H over FT-A,\n? Ability of FT-A to get MDQ on peak,\n? NPV will bias against FT-A (Tennessee explained that a max rate FT-A=20\nshipper wins over FT-H because of total hourly capacity).\n\nGenerators, the alleged primary customer for this service, were lukewarm in=\n=20\ntheir responses.  Calpine and Dynegy said that they=01,d likely stick to FT=\n-A=20\nfor their plants.  Though they encouraged FERC to accept the service, they=\n=20\nwere not convincing that they=01,d sign up for it today. =20\n\nDynegy detailed a list of concerns and issues with the service:\n? Dynegy=01,s not interested in the 12-hour designated block of time, they =\nneed=20\nmore flexibility,\n? Ramp up time isn=01,t adequate,\n? Rates are too heavily weighted toward demand side,\n? Service needs to be somehow standardized for capacity release and=20\ne-commerce,\n? Penalty rates should not be based on power prices,=20\n? Third parties should be able to offer this in competition with Tennessee\n? Offer FT-H as a seasonal service.",

    "body": "Energy Firms' Mixed Message Is Focus of Inquiry\n\nDeregulation: Senate panel will investigate whether suppliers were being\nmisleading when they promised lower rates for consumers while they were also\npredicting bigger profits for investors.\n\nBy ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers\n\nIn the summer of 1999, a top official with a major player in California's\npower market testified during a congressional committee hearing in support of\nspeeding up deregulation. Unleashing market forces, said the Dynegy Inc.\nexecutive, would ensure \"maximum customer savings\" and \"low-cost power.\"\nThat same month, the Houston-based firm made a far different pitch to Wall\nStreet: Deregulation and major swings in electricity prices would boost\nrevenue and stock value. \"We know how to take advantage of volatility spikes\nacross the gas and power market,\" Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson\ndeclared in a publication targeting large investors. \"The energy\nmarketplace,\" he predicted, \"will simply get more volatile.\"\nDynegy was not alone, a review of federal filings, company documents and\npublic records shows. In the years since California's pioneering deregulation\nplan was approved, other major out-of-state energy suppliers were sending\nsimilar, seemingly contradictory signals to the public and stock buyers.\nNow, those divergent messages--electricity prices will fall but corporate\nrevenue and profits will climb--will be a key focus of a special state Senate\ncommittee charged with investigating the alleged manipulation in the power\nmarket.\n\"How you can tell your investors you're about to make a whole ton of money in\nthe very short term, and tell the consumers of California you're about to get\nlower rates?\" said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), a former consumer attorney\nwho is heading the legislative probe.\nInvestigations by the state attorney general and federal regulators are\ncontinuing, but remain largely secret.\nThe Senate panel could offer the most open and wide-ranging examination yet\nof alleged misconduct among power sellers. The bipartisan panel expects to\nbegin requesting documents from power producers as early as today and begin\nhearings in a few weeks. Committee members stress that they are hoping the\npower companies will cooperate but are ready to issue subpoenas if necessary.\n\nSuppliers Deny Misleading Public\nThe legislative probe comes as many state officials are moving aggressively\nto expose alleged market manipulation and overcharges totaling billions of\ndollars by the power suppliers.\n\"Somewhere along the line, there may be a skunk in the woodpile. And if there\nis, we need to find out about it,\" said K. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding),\nthe committee's ranking Republican.\nAnother panel member, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), noted that all\ncompanies try to maximize profits. \"But [we want] to understand how the\nmarket was manipulated and how sellers took advantage of the market.\"\nThe power traders strongly deny acting improperly or sending misleading\nsignals to the public.\n\"Hogwash,\" said Tom Williams, spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy.\nSpokesmen for Dynegy said there was nothing inconsistent in the statements of\ntheir executives.\nThe companies maintain that California's problems stem from soaring\nelectricity demand, lagging power plant construction and a faulty\nderegulation plan adopted by the Legislature in 1996. \"You have a flawed\nstructure there,\" said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa.\nSousa and executives of other power suppliers say their comments to the\ngeneral public and to Wall Street are not contradictory because unfettered\ncompetition--not the California model--would have created opportunities to\nboth make money and cut rates.\nStill, regulators, lawmakers and ratepayer groups note that only half the\npromises made by the power dealers have been realized so far--their earnings\nand stock prices have risen at record rates as electricity prices have soared.\n\"The big lie was, while they were telling ratepayers to 'Trust us, we're\ngoing to lower your rates,' they were planning the entire time to raise the\nrates,\" said San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre, a former federal prosecutor\nwho specialized in fraud cases. Aguirre is representing state ratepayers in a\nclass-action lawsuit against the power companies.\nJust last month, California's independent grid operator reported that many\npower sellers \"used well-planned strategies to ensure maximum possible\nprices.\" Potential overcharges could total nearly $6.3 billion.\nThe Senate panel wants to track information that Dynegy and other generators\nwere providing to the investment community in the 1990s as a possible way of\ndetermining whether they entered the California market with plans to run up\nelectricity costs. Among many other things, the committee plans to seek\ninternal projections of how the firms expected wholesale prices and profits\nto rise under deregulation.\nMembers also want to know how the suppliers expected to recoup billions in\noutlays for California power plants being unloaded by regulated utilities.\nSome of the purchases were far above book value, stunning analysts.\n\"What did they know that the rest of us didn't at the time they were\npurchasing those generations facilities?\" asked Dunn. \"They knew something.\"\nOne thing the power wholesalers say they did know was that tight power\nsupplies in California would probably boost prices, at least for a time.\n\"They were going anywhere where they thought energy [use] would spike\nupward,\" recalled market analyst Joan Goodman, who was familiar with company\npitches. \"California was one of those places because it didn't have\nsufficient [power] plants.\"\nDuke Energy projected that prices would rise after 2000, although the company\nsays it did not foresee the huge increases that occurred, according to\nspokesman Williams.\nHowever, when the company sealed one of the first packages of power plant\npurchases in the state in 1997, Chief Executive Officer Richard Priory said\nin a press release it would \"deliver greater value\" to California customers.\nThe publicity spin was similar when Edison's sprawling beachfront power plant\nin El Segundo changed hands the following year. \"Consumers in California will\nbegin to benefit from more competitively priced electricity and more vibrant\neconomy,\" announced Craig Mataczynski, vice president of Minneapolis-based\nNRG Corp., a partner in the purchase with Dynegy.\n\nBig Growth Was Predicted\nUtilities reaping profits from plant sales also trumpeted the consumer\nwindfall theme. Electricity rates would drop 20% by 2001, Pacific Gas &\nElectric's top executive, Robert Glynn, said in early 1998. \"There is no\nproduct bought on a daily basis that has such a predictable downward price\ntrajectory into the future.\"\nBut to its Wall Street audience, the power suppliers emphasized climbing\nrevenues.\nAtlanta-based Southern Co., now Mirant, told investors in 1999 that its plan\nto buy plants and market power had brought the company to the \"doorstep of\nsignificant growth opportunities.\"\n\"We believe our strategies will result in the best shareholder return\navailable,\" Bill Dahlberg, then-chief executive officer, said shortly after\nbuying three California plants.\nMirant spokeswoman Jamie Stephenson said assurances given the public and\nassumptions directed to Wall Street were \"just a different way of delivering\nthe same message.\" The firm was saying it would be \"reliable to shareholders\nand reliable to consumers.\"\nNow, with rolling blackouts and record electricity bill increases, federal\nand state authorities are alleging that large energy suppliers played the\npower market too hard.\nLast month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it found evidence\nof $124 million in \"unjust and unreasonable\" charges during the severest\nperiods of electricity shortage. The commission, often criticized for being\ntoo lenient on private power companies, ordered the firms to refund the money\nor further justify the charges.\nSome firms are contesting the findings, saying the prices they charged were\njustified.\nInvestigators and regulators have faced a vexing challenge trying to unravel\nthe complex financial workings of the large power traders. The companies\nclosely guard information, and some recently refused to comply with subpoenas\nfrom the state Public Utilities Commission, which is also probing the power\nmarket.\nWhether the Senate investigating committee will have the resources and\ntenacity to get much further remains to be seen. But Democrats and\nRepublicans alike insist they are serious about untangling how the power\nmarket went haywire.\n\"I haven't seen that much smoke where there hasn't been a fire,\" Dunn said.\n\nCopyright 2001 Los Angeles Times",

Gray Davis\nTuesday requested radio and television stations in the state to clear five\nminutes of time Thursday evening so he can make an important announcement\nregarding the state's energy crisis.\n\nDavis is expected to deliver a speech at 6:05 p.m. PST and will likely talk\nabout the state's conservation efforts, a 4,000 megawatt shortfall expected\nnext month, the need to bring new generation online, recent rate hikes\nordered by the California Public Utilities Commission, and the possibility\nfor further rate increases this summer to keep the state's three\ninvestor-owned utilities solvent, sources close to Davis told Dow Jones\nNewswires.\n\n\nThe source said Davis is not expected to discuss a final agreement to buy the\npower lines owned by PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs), unit Pacific Gas &\nElectric, Edison International's (EIX, news, msgs) unit, Southern California\nEdison, and Sempra Energy's (SRE, news, msgs) unit, San Diego Gas & Electric.\n\nDavis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, would not comment on Davis' speech.\n\nIn a memo to the media, Davis' office said the governor will \"deliver an\nimportant live address on energy from his office in Sacramento. During this\nhistoric address to the people of California, the governor will speak in\ndetail about California's energy emergency and make an important\nannouncement.\"\n\nThe last time a California governor interrupted a broadcast schedules was in\n1992, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson delivered a speech about the state's\nbudget problems, a spokesman in Davis' office said.\n\nBut Davis' staff said \"this is the first time in recent memory that a\nGovernor has asked for time statewide to deliver a live address to the people\nof California.\"\n\n-By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nCalif Gov Staff To Speak To Analysts About Energy Crisis ?? ??\nUpdated: Wednesday, April 4, 2001 05:37 PM?ET ???\n?\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Gov. Gray Davis' advisers will speak to\nWall Street analysts Thursday following a live state address on the state's\nenergy crisis, according to an email sent to the financial community and\nobtained by Dow Jones Newswires.\n\nDaivs' staff, in a highly unusual move, asked radio and television\nbroadcasters to clear five minutes of air time Thursday night so Davis can\nmake an \"important announcement\" about the state's months-long energy crisis.\n\nSources close to the governor said Davis will discuss the state's\nconservation efforts, a 4,000 megawatt supply shortfall expected this summer,\nrecent rate increases ordered by state regulators and the possibility for\nfurther rate increases to replenish the state's budget surplus.\n\nDavis is expected to discuss plans for keeping the state's three\ninvestor-owned utilities, PG&E Corp.

He said, however, Davis has received the financial data regarding the\nstate's spending on wholesale electricity and what it expects to spend in the\nmonths ahead.\n\nIn the email sent to Wall Street analysts, Davis' top financial adviser, Joe\nFichera, said the governor's advisers will hold a conference call at 9:45\np.m. EDT (0145 GMT) with analysts followed by a question-and-answer session.\n\nRegarding Davis' speech Thursday, Fichera wrote in his email that \"while\neveryone will wish to speculate on what (Davis) will or will not say, I can\npoint out that the governor has been consistent in his goals to achieve:\nsignificant demand side management, increased generation supply and\nrestoration of the financial health of the investor-owned utilities.\n\n\"All three components are important elements to resolving the energy\nsituation in California and will be addressed by the governor,\" Fichera wrote\nin the email.\n\nIn addition, \"it may go without saying, but the situation in California\ninvolves many moving parts, many constituencies and independent players that\nneed to be brought together to resolve a problem that is of a size and scope\nthat no one anticipated,\" Fichera's email says.\n\n\"It certainly appears confusing and chaotic.

    "body": "September 5, 2000\n\nTo all persons on the Service List in I.99-07-003 (Gas Structure\nOII):\n\nAs part of the approved Gas Structure settlements for PG&E and the\nComprehensive Settlement proposed for SoCalGas and SDG&E, SoCalGas and PG&E\nwould contract with Altra Energy Technologies (Altra) to develop several new\nelectronic trading services including anonymous imbalance trading, OFO\nimbalance rights trading, storage trading and anonymous capacity trading.\nRecently, while working on finalizing contracts to provide these services,\nAltra informed both SoCalGas and PG&E that they are no longer interested in\noffering these new services.  Altra restructured their business and has\ndetermined that this service is not the right business direction for them at\nthis time.\n\nSoCalGas and PG&E were working together to provide a consistent\nservice prior to the announcement by Altra, and we will continue working\ntogether to seek an alternative service provider for these services.  PG&E's\nintention is to investigate the possible alternatives and to present those\nalternatives to the parties to I.99-07-003 along with our suggested plan of\naction as soon as possible.  PG&E understands that SoCal Gas intends to work\nwith parties in a similar fashion.  Since it is unknown how long it will\ntake a service provider other than Altra to develop these services, the\nimplementation dates for trading services by a third party will need to be\nreevaluated once a selection is made and a development schedule set.\n\nWe recognize that a replacement service provider raises a number of\nquestions such as implementation costs and service fees.  We will attempt to\naddress those questions as we investigate the alternatives.  Please send any\ncomments or questions you may have to Ed Vera (EVera@socalgas.com) of\nSoCalGas and Ben Campbell (BCC3@pge.com) of PG&E.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDan Thomas",

    "body": "Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.\n\nThe settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.\n\nWe want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.\n\nKen\n\n\n\nDear ETS Colleague:\n\nOn Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.\n\nIn this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.\n\nThe company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.\n\nBeginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.\n\nOver many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!\n\nStan",

    "date": "Fri, 6 Apr 2001 04:29:00 -0700 (PDT)",
    "body": "Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power\nto the state, a U.S. court rules.\nBy Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton\nBEE STAFF WRITERS\n(Published April 6, 2001)\nIn a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a\nfederal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order\nthat a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state\nwithout guarantee of payment.\nState energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but\ncould precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant\noff-line for maintenance.\nOn March 21, citing \"rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California\nlandscape,\" U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction\nagainst Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators.\nHouston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20\npercent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found\nthat loss of that production \"poses an imminent threat.\"\nBut Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\ngranted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown \"a high\nlikelihood of success on the merits\" of its appeal.\nWhile not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the\nquestion of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel\ndirected that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in\nJuly.\nThe decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least\ntemporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which\nmaintains and controls power transmissions.\nIt gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any\nof its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers.\n\"It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change\nanything over the weekend,\" said Detmers. \"But if Reliant decided on a\nunilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely\ncould have a system emergency.\"\nReliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but\ndeclined to specify their next move.\n\"Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California,\" said company\nlobbyist Marty Wilson, and \"is still of a mind to want to cooperate.\"\nWithout further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District\nCourt decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co.,\nalleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and\nproduction of electricity.\nThe judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of\ninterstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\nHe ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales\ninto federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order,\nand that goes directly to an appellate court.\nThe lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two\nother generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though\nthe agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly\nin debt.\nBecause Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay\ntheir bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to\nthe utilities.\nThe other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston\nand Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing &\nTrading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue\nsupplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to\nsell to companies that are not creditworthy.\nBut Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can\nrescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice.\n\"My hope is this is a temporary setback,\" said Robinson. He added, however,\nthat the practical effect is \"at least for now, we don't have a tool to\ncompel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do\" -- respond to\nemergency demands for power.\nReliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no\njurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators\nand the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must\nsettle any disputes about terms of those tariffs.\nIn issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special\nexpertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO.\n\"Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court\nagrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper,\" he\nsaid. \"But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short\nsupply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at\nrisk.\"\nImmediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for\nthe ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend\nthe suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its\nview that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has\njurisdiction.\nDamrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday.\nIn a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for\nenergy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big\nutilities and sell its power on the open market.\nTimber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants\nthat produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in\nSacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell\nits power to PG&E.\nThe ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative\nenergy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell\ntheir comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state.",

The company said it is taking this action in light of its\nunreimbursed energy costs which are now increasing by more than $300 million\nper month, continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the\ncompany, and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Governor Gray\nDavis and his representatives are going nowhere.\n\nNeither PG&E Corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries, including its\nNational Energy Group, have filed for Chapter 11 reorganization or are\naffected by the utility's filing.\n\n\"We chose to file for Chapter 11 reorganization affirmatively because we\nexpect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution, which\nthus far the State and the State's regulators have been unable to achieve,\"\nsaid Robert D. Glynn, Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. \"The\nregulatory and political processes have failed us, and now we are turning to\nthe court.\"\n\nGlynn added, \"Our objective is to move through the Chapter 11 reorganization\nprocess as quickly as possible, without disruption to our operations or\ninconvenience to our customers. Throughout this crisis, our 20,000 employees\nhave been and remain committed to providing safe and reliable service to the\n13 million Californians who depend on us to deliver their gas and\nelectricity.\"\n\nPacific Gas and Electric Company decided to file for the protection of\nChapter 11 primarily due to:\n\n\n--  Failure by the state to assume the full procurement\nresponsibility for Pacific Gas and Electric's \"net open\nposition\" as was provided under AB1X. This has the result of\nincreasing financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy\nprocurement costs, which the utility estimates to be\napproximately $300 million or more per month.\n\n--  The impact of actions by the California Public Utilities\nCommission (CPUC) on March 27, 2001, and April 3, 2001, that\ncreated new payment obligations for the company and undermined\nits ability to return to financial viability.\n\n--  Lack of progress in negotiations with the state to provide\nrecovery of $9 billion in wholesale power purchases made by\nthe utility since June 2000, which have not been recoverable\nin frozen rates.\n\n--  The adoption by the CPUC of an illegal and retroactive\naccounting change that would appear to eliminate our true\nuncollected wholesale costs.\n\n\"In addition, despite Pacific Gas & Electric's best efforts to work with the\nState of California to reach a consensual, responsible, fair and\ncomprehensive solution to California's energy crisis, no agreement has been\nreached with the Governor and the Governor's representatives have\ndramatically slowed the pace and the progress of discussions over the past\nmonth.\n\n\"Furthermore since last fall, we have filed comprehensive plans for resolving\nthis matter with the CPUC, but they have not acted affirmatively on them,\"\nsaid Glynn.\n\nOn October 4, 2000, Pacific Gas and Electric sought emergency rate action by\nthe CPUC. In November 2000, we filed our rate stabilization plan, which, if\nadopted, would have increased electric prices by an initial 25 percent,\ncompared with the 46 percent recently adopted by the CPUC. Neither request\nwas acted upon. Had the state acted at that time:\n\n-- Pacific Gas and Electric would have been kept creditworthy;\n\n\n--  Pacific Gas and Electric would have been able to enter into\nlong-term power purchase contracts at prices lower than those\nannounced by the state;\n\n--  The state would not have had to almost exhaust the state's\nbudget surplus by spending billions of dollars to purchase\npower for the utility's customers;\n\n--  The state would not now need to issue billions of dollars in\nbonds to cover these power purchases; and\n\n--  The state would not now be advancing a proposal to spend\nbillions of dollars to purchase the state's three\ninvestor-owned utility's electric transmission systems.\n\n\"This year, the state has spent more than $3 billion on power purchases and,\nwith the CPUC, has arranged to be reimbursed for these expenses,\" noted\nGlynn. \"In contrast, since June Pacific Gas and Electric Company has spent $9\nbillion in excess of revenues to pay for power for its customers and\nexhausted its ability to continue borrowing, but there has been no progress\non a plan to reimburse it for those expenditures as provided by law.\n\n\"Statements by the Governor and other public officials since last September\ngave us reason to believe that a solution could be reached outside the\ncontext of Chapter 11 that would restore the utility's financial viability\nand enable it to meet its financial obligations equitably. However, these\nstatements have not been followed up by constructive actions, and a\nreorganization in Chapter 11 is now the most feasible means of resolution.\"\n\nThe utility will utilize existing resources to continue operating its\nbusiness during bankruptcy, including paying vendors and suppliers in full\nfor goods and services received after the filing. The utility will pay\nelectric commodity suppliers as provided by law. The utility intends to\ncontinue normal electric and gas transmission and distribution functions\nduring the Chapter 11 process. Employees will continue to be paid. Health\ncare plans and other benefits for employees and most retirees will continue.\nThe utility's qualified retirement plans for retirees and vested employees\nare fully funded and protected by federal law.\n\nNotice\n\nA media teleconference will be held today at 10:15 A.M. Pacific Daylight Time\nto discuss this announcement. Pacific Gas and Electric Company Chairman\nRobert D. Glynn, Jr., and Pacific Gas and Electric Company President and CEO\nGordon R. Smith will be available for questions. The dial-in number is\n888/469-2078, and the password for access is \"media.\" An investment community\nconference call to discuss Pacific Gas and Electric Company's Chapter 11\nfiling has been scheduled for 11:15 A.M. Pacific Daylight Time today. A\nreal-time webcast of this conference call can be accessed at www.pgecorp.com.\n\n\n\nCONTACT: PG&E Corporation\nNews Department 415/973-5930",

SDGE.  It went very well.  Judge Whaley began by\nasking Campbell to argue first, since \"It seems to me you're flying in the\nface of the filed rate doctrine.\"  The bulk of the argument focused on two\nissues:  (1) what if anything is the effect of FERC's inability to issue\nretroactive rate relief, and (2) (to a much lesser extent) how a class\naction based on SDGE customers only avoided the discrimination prong of the\ndoctrine.  Campbell's argument was ineffective, consisting mostly of his\npreferred social policy rather than any law.  His most substantive argument\nwas that filed rate was based on a res judicata-like theory, and since\nmarket-based rates are not passed on by FERC before they go into effect, an=\nd\ncan't changed be retroactively, resort to the courts was appropriate.\n\nI was not asked any specific questions at first, but was rather just asked\nto respond.  I began by advising the court of the July 25th order in which\nFERC held that filed rate applied to these market-based rates, then\ndiscussed Norwood, then addressed the res judicata analogy by pointing to\nthe cases that hold that mere filing, rather than agency review, invokes th=\ne\ndoctrine.  Whaley asked me a couple of questions about retroactive relief,\nthe most significant of which was along the following lines:  \"So what you\nare saying is that if, at the end of the day, it is determined that there i=\ns\nno right of retroactive relief, then that's just like a statute of\nlimitations or any other limitation on a right or remedy that doesn't effec=\nt\nFERC's jurisdiction.\"  I answered affirmatively, stating that the salient\npoint was that it was within Congress' power to decide how this type of\ninterstate commerce was to be regulated, and that if Congress imposed\nlimitations on remedies for illegal behavior, we were all bound by that.  H=\ne\nseemed content with that answer.\n\nCampbell replied in an argument that was pretty close to saying, \"There mus=\nt\nalways be a remedy somewhere.\"  Interestingly, Whaley then asked Campbell a\ncouple of times whether he would concede Keogh's applicability if there was\na FERC remedy.  I think this was a setup, and Campbell walked into it,\nbasically saying yes.  Whaley didn't close the trap, but it would not\nsurprise me if he finds that the existence of a remedy at the agency doesn'=\nt\nmatter, and since Campbell admits that Keogh would bar the claim if there\nwere a remedy, he's out of court.\n\nWhaley took it under submission and said he would issue an order.  I think\nhe'll rule very narrowly, stressing that Campbell's is a claim under the\nFPA.  I tried to broaden his thinking, arguing that we ought not allow ever=\ny\nplaintiff to attempt to reinvent the regulatory system by dreaming up every\nmanner of legal attack on filed rates, but I suspect he saw through that an=\nd\nwill rule narrowly.  Anyway, I expect a good result.\n\n\n\nThis email may contain material that is confidential, privileged and/or\nattorney work product for the sole use of the intended recipient.

    "body": "Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.\n\nThe settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.\n\nWe want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.\n\nKen\n\n\n\nDear ETS Colleague:\n\nOn Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.\n\nIn this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.\n\nThe company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.\n\nBeginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.\n\nOver many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!\n\nStan",

Kaiser Aluminum closed its =\nsmelting operations in the Pacific Northwest in late 2000, choosing to rese=\nll contracted power from the BPA on the spot market. According to the Spoke=\nsman Review, \"Kaiser netted more than $460 million from the sales.\" Other a=\nluminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring=\n2001 with Bonneville. Under these agreements, the companies agreed to keep=\nsmelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region, and BPA agre=\ned, in return, to give the smelters, when they restarted operations, a $20 =\nper megawatt-hour (MWh) credit for obtaining power from sources other than =\nBPA. Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA tha=\nt negates a \"take-or-pay\" clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the f=\nederal power whether used or not. BPA said, \"Under the agreement signed tod=\nay, Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take=\nall the power under the contract...And if [BPA] can't resell it, we are no=\nt going to hold [Kaiser] liable for the difference,\" Clearing Up reported. =\nAs a concession for the elimination of the \"take-or-pay\" clause, Kaiser wil=\nl receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its 240 MW load. Ka=\niser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was =\nusing the money it had gained reselling power \"to pay down long-term debt, =\nrebuild a refinery in Louisiana and reward executives with excessive bonuse=\ns,\" rather than splitting the money between workers that had been laid off,=\nthe BPA, and building generation, AP reported.

Texan Doll \"had prev=\niously worked for several communications and consulting firms,\" and will be=\nreceiving a salary of $200,000 as the power authority's CEO, according to =\nthe San Francisco Chronicle. S. David Freeman, the authority's chair, will =\nretain his post. Freeman said he will \"handle fewer administrative duties,\"=\nand will \"be able to devote more time to reaching out to interest groups s=\nuch as the Legislature and consumer groups,\" The Chronicle reported. Accord=\ning to a 7 October report in the Orange County Register, consumer groups, b=\nusinesses, and the legislature have questioned the recent actions of the po=\nwer authority, which has vowed to secure nearly 3,000 megawatts (MW) of pow=\ner by summer 2002 to avoid power shortages. The power authority, which was =\ncreated by Governor Gray Davis and the state Legislature in May 2001, can i=\nssue up to $5 billion in bonds to bolster the state's power supply through =\nfinancing new renewable generation or peaker projects. The Register said th=\nat businesses and consumer groups are worried that higher electricity rates=\ncould be the result of the power authority initiative to bring 1,000 MW of=\ngreen power and 2,000 MW of peaker generation on line by summer 2002. The =\nstate's Joint Legislative Audit Committee would look into the authority's p=\nlanned purchases, according to the committee chair, Assembly member Fred Ke=\neley.

Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Williams Cos., and Relia=\nnt Energy were the companies specifically mentioned. Under a 19 June FERC o=\nrder, price limits were established in 11 Western states to help tame the v=\nolatile electricity spot market. The June order stated that companies charg=\ning in excess of the mitigated price had seven days past the end of the mon=\nth in question to file justifications for their overcharges. The 5 October =\norder said that the aforementioned companies filed justifications, but all =\nwere rejected, and that other companies that overcharged during July, but d=\nid not file justifications, would also be subject to ordered refunds. Altho=\nugh FERC did not release specific figures, the California Independent Syste=\nm Operator said that total overcharges for the month amounted to $260,000, =\nThe Los Angeles Times reported. The commission's order explained the reject=\nion of cost justifications for the four companies. The explanations by Mira=\nnt and Dynegy, filed more than seven days after July ended, were \"untimely =\nand...neither company supported in detail its actual costs for its transact=\nions,\" according to the document. Reliant's filing was \"not consistent with=\nthe requirements of the June 19 Order,\" and Willams \"did not provide any c=\nost support for its transactions beyond restating general objections to the=\ncommission's pricing methodology,\" the commissioners wrote.

They indicated a critical need for supply TODAY\nto serve the California marketplace.  Secretary Richardson indicated he will\nexercise his emergency power under the Federal Power Act [section 202(c)] to\ndirect generation to California.  The Secretary indicated that DOE, under the\nFPA, will set a fair price for the power.\n\nIEP requests all its members to deliver as much generation as possible to\nCalifornia ASAP in order to avert potential shortages.\n\nIn addition, the Governor and Senator Feinstein called for regionwide price\ncaps and mandatory, reasonable long-term contracts between generators and the\nutilities.

Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a \"material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,\" it warned.\n\nFor Related News, Double Click on one of these codes:\n[nPL2779110] [CRU] [ENE.N] [US] [PGF] [MRG] [ELG] [NGS] [PLTN] [LEN] [CRU] [ENE] [US]\nTuesday, 20 November 2001 04:33:58\nRSF [Historical News] {C}\nENDS\n\n\nWillis Philip\nEnron Wholesale Services\nEast Power Trading\n(713) 853-0961",

When there was a threat of a windfall profits tax on  the\ngasoline companies earlier this year, Cal-Tax responded quickly and helped\nstop the effort.\n\nAs the legislative rhetoric heats up we need to start thinking about\nbecoming more proactive.  This membership is one way of getting help on tax\nissues.  I encourage others to suggest other proactive steps we might take\nindividually or as a group.  And while I'm at it ---  I also recommend\nmembership in Cal. Manufacturers Assoc.\n\nThe Cal-Tax membership is very reasonable, $10,000 for a Board position and\n5,000 for corporate non-Board level.  The group has very good information\nand email services which your tax people would appreciate.  For information\non membership, pls call Joyce Showalter, 530/335-4032.

Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.\nThis issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ?\nAt this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions.\nCan you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?

Our consulting agreement with IGS (which\nhas now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated\nusing the net present value of any contract \"identified by IGS\" and entered\ninto during the term of the consulting agreement.  During the term of the\nagreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.  IGS\nis now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive\nfee.  While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern,\nSouthern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup\nExpansion capacity.  Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.  So, while\nMark can certainly claim he \"identified\" the deal, he was not alone in doing\nso.\n\nSteve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to\nLorraine to verify facts).  Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money\nthey will be happy.  We would really like to preserve what has been a good\nworking relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we\ncould probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive\nfee.  However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the\nonly party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee,\nthis position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW.\nThe amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we\nuse in calculating net present value.\n\nIf you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to\nIGS, let me know.  I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit\nthat Mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do\ndecide to take us to court.",

Stan has asked me (on a very confidential basis) to explore various \"buy back\" options for NNG, including raising a lot of money!  I wanted to get your thoughts on certain customers' willingness to participate in an ownership interest in NNG.  I did not want to meet with Dave and his team given the Dynegy transition. I am free all morning except at 9 and this afternoon except from 2 to 4.",

(ENE)\n10Q Info Consistent With Plusses For DYN In Deal\n\nSummary\n\nENE filed its 3Q'01 10Q last night with information ranging from updates on\naccounting restatements, balance sheet details and discussions of off-balance\nsheet obligations.\n\nImportant disclosures were made related to acceleration of debt repayment due to\nrecent credit rating downgrades, reduced 4Q'01 eps expectations and liquidity.\n\nENE has $690 million in debt due on Nov 27 because of recent downgrades. We\nexpect this obligation to be renegotiated, satisfied out of the current cash\nposition of $1.5 billion or collateralized.\n\nA reduction in 4Q'01 eps expectations because of ENE issues and other items was\npart of our recent estimate reduction from $0.48 to $0.40 for 4Q'01, (before\nnon-\nrecurring items) discussed in a report dated Nov 5, 2001. We now expect 4Q eps\nto be in a $0.25-$0.35 range.\n\nAlso in the 10Q, ENE describes other items discussed in the conference call of\nNov 14 including $8 billion of \"non-core\" (principally international and\nbroadband assets) that are for sale, an ability to issue $2 billion of\nadditional equity before the Dynegy (DYN, 43.60, Strong Buy) deal closes and a\ntotal debt balance of $16.3 billion ($13.0 \"on balance sheet\" and $3.3 billion\n\"off balance sheet\").\n\nThe \"material adverse change (MAC)\" clause in the DYN/ENE deal was described as\nconsidered if other ENE liabilities (primarily litigation) exceed $2 billion net\nof insurance or reserves. If an additional $1.5 billion in liabilities is\nassessed a MAC is deemed to have occurred.\n\nIn assessing a 90% probability that the DYN/ENE deal will be completed, we note\nthat ENE is not a going concern without it, DYN demonstrably benefits by it\n(please see report dated Nov 9,'01) and Chevron/Texaco (CVX, 82.91) supports it.\nIn our view, positive comments by CVX yesterday, and the $1.5 billion cash\ninfusion to ENE from CVX on Nov 13, add to the support shown for the deal.\n\nWe continue to rate DYN Strong Buy because of its earnings and valuation upside\npotential in this deal. Our current eps est for DYN of $2.55 for '02 moves to\n$3.25 or higher with a completed deal. Our DYN target price of $54 is subject to\nupward revision as well. For ENE, our Strong Buy rating expects that the deal\nspread, currently about 30% will narrow as progress is made toward a closing.\n\nThe author's immediate family owns less than 250 shares of ENE.\n\nPrice        Target                     Mkt.

While we will honor current\ncommitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to\nuse the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening\nis that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing\ndelegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.\n\nWe are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City\nCouncil that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of\nagreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by\nthe City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our\nBoard and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep\nus operating.\n\nI've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are\ndoing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed\ncontracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,\nif it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new\nyear begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be\ncomfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any\nchanges to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the\navailability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we\nhave already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our\nboilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying\nto do here.\n\nI Hope most of you will respond.

    "body": "-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Enron Office Of The Chairman\nSent: Fri 1/4/2002 4:46 PM\nTo: DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2\nCc:\nSubject: Northern Natural Gas\n\n\n\nYesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.\n\nThe settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.\n\nWe want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.\n\nKen\n\n\n\nDear ETS Colleague:\n\nOn Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.\n\nIn this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.\n\nThe company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.\n\nBeginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.\n\nOver many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!\n\nStan",

Julie Kearney (in our human resources department) will be gone today through Wednesday of next week. So by Thursday of next week we should be able to set up an interview schedule and go from there.\n\nI have answered a few of your questions in your email below. We can go over the others when we speak next. Thanks for the good questions.\n\nBill\n\n\n: Jhadams69@aol.com [mailto:Jhadams69@aol.com]\nSent: Monday, October 08, 2001 8:36 PM\nTo: Williams III, Bill\nSubject: Homework\n\n\n\nHi Bill -\nI read through the stuff you gave me and I do have a few questions... First, did you get my resume and letter, and did they download OK?  I am looking forward to the interview and, assuming I do well, am anxious to get started.  So let me know about a timeline when you can, please.\n\nWhat kind of affect will a west-wide RTO have on Enron?  I saw in a couple of the newsletters that FERC is pushing hard for it.  -A west wide RTO is very good for Enron as it would facilitate moving energy around the grid and contribute to marketing efficiency.\n\n\"Wood also proposes FERC initiate a rulemaking on market design and structure, to translate the eight RTO functions in Order No. 2000 into concrete protocols for the RTO organizations.\"  Is there anywhere I can find out what the 8 RTO functions are?  You should be able to find more information regarding RTO's on the nerc and ferc websites (national energy reliability council and federal energy regulatory commision)\n\nA lot of information in the newsletters was about natural gas and the volatility in its cost.  Do you do any trading in gas?  We do not trade gas on real-time, but some of the forward traders pick up gas positions to hedge themselves against price volatility on the power side.\n\nCanada -- New Alberta Power Plant.  Do you move any Canadian electricity?  We sell energy to Canadian entities frequently, though we do not schedule the energy into Canada. We deliver the energy to them at the BC-US border.\n\nThe CPUC has suspended direct access switches.  What kind of impact does this have on trading?  How does California's Department of Water Resources and its liabilities fit into the mess in CA?  This requires a bit more of an explanation than I have a chance for here.\n\nNorthwest utilities claimed they took an unwarranted $500 million beating in the 6 months of high spot prices.  A judge said they were \"just and fair.\"  Will the denial of this claim affect the trading floor?  Yes, it means we do not have to spend months unwinding trades. In short, its good for Enron--and everyone else who bought and sold energy in the NW.\n\nEnron and PGE... There is a pending sale of PGE to NWN.  Will this have any effect on you?  To put it bluntly, will you still be able to hire from the outside?  Will the sale do anything to the $100 million line of credit that PGE obtained from Enron?   The sale to NW natural will not affect us other than driving up our stock price.\n\nHow close are we to having BPA's transmission system under FERC jurisdiction?  What does Enron think of that, or do they care?\nDynegy, Exelon, Entergy, Cinergy -- who are these guys?    Dynegy and Exelon are power companies (like Enron)-Entergy and Cinergy are trading regions. And we would love to have BPA under FERC jurisdiction but it will likely not happen soon.\n\n\"Exelon said ... it would reduce its ... 2001 estimates due to power market volatility and ... it would cut an (additional) 450 positions.\"   Does Enron employment fluctuate with the market, or did Exelon just do a shitty job?  That would be the latter.\n\nSoCalEd owes Enron a bunch of money.  What happens if it goes bankrupt?  How does that affect Enron overall, and would it change the daily trading process?  -Bankruptcy of SCE would not affect our trading, but I am not aware of what our exposure to SCE is. I believe it is minimal on the trading desk.\n\nTell me about Qualifying Facility (QF) suppliers. This will take a while.\n\nHow will \"green power\" enter into your mix?  It doesn't yet. \"Green power\" just makes Oregonians and those in Northern California feel good.\n\n\"Cal-ISO's director of grid planning ... testified that the cost  (of 1500 MW of new capacity) is justified as a way to prevent power sellers' market power and to deal with drought conditions in the PNW and CA that limit hydroelectricity production.  Those two issues loomed large as contributing factors in CA's energy crisis...\"  As California creates new capacity, will that impact the ability of traders to do what they do, or will they just have more power to deal with? A long or short market is just a part of trading. For example, the market is currently experiencing some unit outages and has exhibited some volatility as a result. There is still a ton of capacity and the market is not moving as drastically as it might have.\n\nAll for now.  Thanks for the information. The acronyms are incredible.  It was like these things were written in a foreign language.  Looking forward to hearing from you.   The acronyms are incredible, but they all make sense after a while.\n\nJohn",

    "body": "Greetings:\nThe CEC issued a report today that says that unless the ISO experiences\n\"extraordinarily high\" temperatures next year there is no supply problem.\nIEP is reviewing this document and will provide further correspondence as we\nprepare a response.\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to give me a call.\nThanks,\nKatie Kaplan\nManager of State Policy Affairs\nIndependent Energy Producers Association\n(916) 448-9499\n\n\n\nThe report can be found at:\nhttp://www.energy.ca.gov/reports/2000-11-20_300-00-006.PDF\n\nThe Press Release:\nCalifornia Energy Commission Report Released\n\nSummer of 2001 Electricity Supplies Better Than\nExpected\n\n\n\nSacramento -- California should have enough power to meet its\nelectricity demand next summer, unless the State experiences extraordinarily\nhot\nWeather, according to a study released today by the Energy Commission.\n\n\"With new resources coming on-line and new conservation measures taking\neffect, next summer looks better than expected, if we manage our\nresources properly,\" said Steve Larson, Energy Commission Executive\nDirector.\n\nThe study, prepared as part of a response to legislation enacted in\nSeptember, quantified the amount of electricity demand and supply expected\nin the\nsummer of 2001. \"We produced this analysis from the ground up,\"\ncommented Larson. \"We looked at every power plant and source of electricity\navailable to the State to give us a realistic appraisal of where we\nstand for next summer. Energy Commission staff projected expected peak\nelectricity\ndemand using three temperature scenarios.\"\n\nThe analysis indicated that under the \"most likely\" temperature\nconditions, next year's electricity peak demand will be 47,266 megawatts,\nwhich reflects\na reduction of 220 megawatts of demand because of new utility and state\nenergy conservation initiatives. Operating reserve requirements add an\nadditional 2,200 to 3,000 megawatts demand in order to provide a 7\npercent margin, raising the generation needed to a minimum of 50,303\nmegawatts.\n\nIf California experiences a warmer than normal summer, the electricity\nsystem will require 48,845 megawatts plus operating reserve requirements,\nwhich raises the total to 51,882 megawatts. Under this scenario, total\nexpected resources are 52,550 megawatts. Should the State experience\nextremely hot temperatures, which has a 1-in-10 year likelihood of\noccurring, 53,104 megawatts will be needed (50,068 megawatts of demand plus\noperating reserve requirements), with expected resources of 52,190\nmegawatts.\n\nAn additional 1,888 - 3,087 megawatts of potential generation is\ncurrently under development and may be available for part or all of the\nsummer.\n\nThe Energy Commission's demand forecast takes into consideration\nexpected economic conditions and household growth in the State. These two\nfactors influence demand for air conditioning which drives summer peak\ndemand for electricity. The Energy Commission's staff supply outlook\nincludes\nexisting in-state and out-of-state generation; new power plants\nexpected to be on-line and generating electricity by August 1, 2000; and\nelectricity\nimports and exports. The supply outlook also includes new renewable\nenergy projects and energy efficiency measures and initiatives made possible\nby\nfunding under AB 970, which was approved by the Governor in September,\n2000.\n\nCalifornia's electricity demand is growing at 2 percent per year. To\nensure that there are adequate supplies of electricity to meet future\ndemand, it will\nbe important to add new, efficient generation as well as to implement\nenergy efficiency and demand reduction strategies.\n\nSince restructuring occurred in March 1998, the Energy Commission has\napproved six major power plant projects with a combined generation\ncapacity of 4,708 megawatts. In addition another 15 electricity\ngenerating projects totaling over 7,000 megawatts and an estimated capital\ninvestment\nof more than $4 billion are being considered for licensing by the\nCommission.\n\nThe report, Summer of 2001 Forecasted Electricity Demand and Supplies,\nis available on the Energy Commission's Web Site at:",

The discovery\nthat Enron pursues will obviously need to be coordinated with litigation\ncounsel representing Enron in the various California civil litigations and\ninvestigations.\n\nThe mediator's recommendation largely ignores two of the issues that were set\nfor mediation (moving CA power supply to the forward markets and restoring\ncreditworthiness of CA purchasers) and instead deals exclusively with the\nthird issue:  Did any supplier overcharge for post-October 1, 2000,\nshort-term (24 hrs or less) sales into the PX and ISO and, if so, should the\nsupplier refund the overcharge or have it offset against amounts owed the\nsupplier?\n\nThe mediator did not find a specific overcharge amount. Instead, he opined\nthat, while not the $8.9 billion claimed by the CA delegation, overcharges\n\"do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion\ndollars in an aggregate sum.\"\n\nPer the mediator's recommendation, the evidentiary hearing should address the\ndetails of a methodology for determining how much each supplier overcharged.\nThe \"single\" methodology recommended by the mediator is a modified,\nretroactive application of the price ceiling that FERC ordered imposed\nprospectively on the entire west in a June 19 order.  That methodology\nclasses as an overcharge any amount charged between October 2, 2000, and May\n28, 2001, that exceeded the operating cost of the least efficient gas-fired\nturbine dispatched in CA in an hour plus an adder for O&M, a credit premium\nand NOx.  The recommended methodology deviates from the prospective price\nceiling in several respects, including that it would be applied in all hours,\nwithout discount, and would reflect actual heat rates and separate actual\nhourly natural gas prices for southern CA and northern CA, resulting in two\nseparate proxy prices.\n\nThe mediator recommends that this methodology be applied to all suppliers,\neven those that did not supply power wholly from gas-fired turbines.\nNevertheless, in a contradictory passage, the mediator goes on to recognize\nthat his recommended methodology \"may not be appropriate for all sellers,\"\nbut that any sellers advocating a different methodology \"should bear the\nburden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the\nmethodology recommended herein over the entire refund period..\"  (emphasis\nadded).\n\nAssuming that the agency largely follows the recommendation of the mediator,\nthen it appears Enron, working through Seabron, can pursue one or two basic\ntheories.  First and most simply, Enron can accede to the mediator's\nmethodology and work with the large generators (Duke, Reliant, Dynegy,\nMirant) to force up the proxy price (and lower the overcharge amount) that\nthe mediator's methodology produces.  Alternatively, in addition to trying to\nforce up the proxy price, Enron can try to develop a theory that the\nmediator's methodology either should not apply to power marketers or should\napply differently to them.  This second approach will likely be joined by\nother non-thermal generator suppliers, such as PowerEx.  The obvious risk in\npursing this second approach is that Enron might become exposed to discovery\ninto the cost basis of its book over the entire refund period..\n\nThose of you who will need or want to discuss the issues with Seabron, please\nrespond by letting me know as between Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next\nweek, which works better for you for a meeting in Washington or a\nteleconference.",

    "date": "Fri, 13 Jul 2001 06:46:00 -0700 (PDT)",
    "body": "Yesterday, at the Midwest ISO, we successfully managed to quash the MISO's\n\"at least one source-to-sink reservation\" proposal.\n\nMISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on\ntransmission reservations, and felt that the Entergy Source/Sink policy was\ntoo restrictive, but the policy of not requiring source-to-sink at any point\nwas too relaxed.  Their proposal was that \"at least one\" reservation on a\ntag/schedule must have the true source-to-sink; otherwise, the tag/schedule\nwould be denied for improper use.\n\nRepresentatives from CINergy, Duke, Dynegy, ACES, Ameren and LG&E worked with\nme to fight this concept, arguing that it was effectively identical to the\nEntergy Source/Sink policy in almost all cases.  After a meeting and two\nconference calls, in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually\npressed for their option, we finally managed to convince them that it was\nunacceptable.\n\nThe new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows:\n\n1.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation\nspecified accurate source and sink, the tag/schedule will be approved.\n2.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation\ndid NOT specify accurate source and sink, but analysis indicates the\ntransaction can flow without compromising reliability, the tag/schedule will\nbe approved\n3.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation\ndid NOT specify accurate source and sink, and analysis indicates the\ntransaction cannot flow without compromising reliability (i.e., the\ntransaction will cause or contribute to a constraint), the tag/schedule will\nbe denied\n\nWhile this is not as unrestrictive as we might want, it allows us a great\ndeal more flexibility that the Entergy Source/Sink barrier while at the same\ntime allaying the MISO's reliability concerns.  Effectively, this allows us\nto redirect both firm and non-firm at the time of tagging/scheduling without\na loss in transmission priority.  Not only will this give us more flexibility\nwithin MISO, but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under\nthe IRCA.\n\nThis also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy\nS/S policy is not required for reliability, as other entities are able to\nmeet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are\nnecessary.\n\nAs an aside, we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will\nallow for \"partial\" redirects of service on a short term basis (the Separate\nproposal referenced in the attached document).  This will allow us to\naccomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy, but reduce the availability\nrisk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is\ntagged/scheduled.  These two proposals, when combined, will allow us for much\nmore flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra\nproviders chant whenever we ask for innovation and change.\n\nA detailed write-up of the work accomplished is attached.  Proposal 4,\nDiscussion item \"Confusing POR/POD Naming,\" Discussion Item \"MISO Proposal\n...time of scheduling,\" and the Resolutions should be of primary interest to\nthose wishing to see more detail on the directions MISO is heading.\n\nAndy Rodriquez\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\n713-345-3771",

During this time Northwest will have no access t=\no\nClay Basin.  Additionally, Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its La\nPlata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5,\n2002, and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline.\n\nDuring the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compresso=\nr\nhave exceeded capacity on a regular basis.  With Clay Basin shut in,\nNorthwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired.  Northwes=\nt\nwill have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a result\ncannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes.\n\nIf north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during the\nQuestar and Transwestern maintenance, Northwest will take the following\nsteps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system: reduce line\npack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance; cut\nnorth-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Plata\nto Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling\nthrough Kemmerer; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries\nfrom receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximate\nconfirmed nominations;  entitle for undertakes or overtakes, as appropriate=\n;\nand finally, if required, Northwest will issue operational flow orders.\n\nIf net scheduled volumes north through Northwest's Kemmerer Compressor do\nnot exceed physical capacity, Northwest will have much greater flexibility\nduring the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins.  Northwest's customers can\nhelp themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule b=\ny\nsecuring adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their Jackson\nPrairie storage during this work.\n\nNorthwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of\nthe Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring the\nsituation closely.  Northwest will take every opportunity to relax system\nrestrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate.  Northwest is\nconfident that if its customers respond prudently, the impact of the\nTranswestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact your Marketing Services\nrepresentative.",

Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.\n\nMany CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.

Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.\n\nI know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.

    "body": "This is why the CPUC has opened its recent OII.  The problem now receives\nnational attention.\n\nNov 16,2000\n\nCalifornia Power Plants Get Jolt\nAs Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut\n\nBy Rebecca Smith\nStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their\nlimits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp\ncurtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity.\n\nThe power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce\nelectricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns\nthat an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is\nputting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk.\n\nThat's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.\nburn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to\nshift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were\nconstructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel\nflexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than\ngas and generally has been costlier.\n\nIn California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San\nDiego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow\nnew heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies\nlast summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to\nsolve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now,\nthey're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical\nproblem and into a gas problem.\n\nOne official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single\nfuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a\ncomprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas\nand electricity affect each other. \"We don't just need new generating plants\nand transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,\" said Terry Winter, chief\nexecutive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the\norganization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies.  \"You\ncan't look at these things in isolation.\"\n\nThe natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,\nSan Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of\nindustrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In\nCalifornia, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas,\nand industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating\nplants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the\nolder plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But it didn't\nlike doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when  they\nburn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power\nplants here need to operate.\n\nThe San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short\nof power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including\nmany of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair\nafter being run at capacity limits throughout the summer.\n\nWhat's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to\nbegin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and\nnot big power plants.\n\nThe problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because\ngas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation,\nbut especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last\nsummer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of\ngas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices\nalso have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal\nunits to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8%\nfrom a year ago.\n\n\"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,\" said\nJohn Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of\nEnron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in the Northeast, based\non cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.\n\nHigh prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In\nCalifornia the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was\n$228 per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the\nprice a year earlier.",

[ENE], already jarred by a spiraling stock price, a collapsed merger and massive debt, will be under the scrutiny of Congress.\nRep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on Thursday announced hearings into Enron's accounting practices and into what impact the company's problems might have on electricity and natural gas markets.\n\n\"We're very interested in how the company handled its internal books,\" said Kenneth Johnson, a spokesman for the congressman, adding that the committee's general counsel had been directed to investigate circumstances leading up to the collapse.\nBankruptcy may be the smartest option for Enron Corp. as the once-mighty energy trader tries to extricate itself from a tangled mess of junk credit and massive debt, a bankruptcy expert and professor said.\n\"I would assume it would lead to a sale of the company, which was coming anyway,\" said Jay Westbrook, a bankruptcy expert who teaches at the University of Texas School of Law.\n\"Bankruptcy provides a lot of protections that makes it easier to do, and it buys time to find out what this company's really worth. That was Dynegy's problem - trying to figure out what the company was worth.\"\nAnalysts predicted bankruptcy was Enron's only option as the humbled company limped into limited operation Thursday to let skittish traders cut ties with it. The top executive for Dynegy Inc. [DYN], Enron's smaller rival and would-be savior, also detailed how Enron's financial \"decay\" caused a rescue merger to crumble.\nStunned employees tried to find hope in the fact that Enron - just months ago a towering presence in the energy markets - had yet to make a bankruptcy filing.\nEnronOnline, the company's Internet-based trading system, was up and running on a limited basis for traders to finish transactions and offset credit risk with the company. The site, which was the first of its kind, was shut down for several hours Wednesday after Dynegy Inc. called off the merger.\nBut analysts said that operation, which was Enron's chief money maker, needs cash and credit to survive - both of which are scarce for the trader.\n``Everyone should have at least some skepticism that it could ever emerge from Chapter 11,'' A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim said Thursday. ``The energy trading business has probably taken such a hit to its reputation that it would be difficult to retrench and go forward.''\nEnron officials did not return repeated calls for comment.\nA haggard Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive of Dynegy Inc., said a steady stream of revelations of weak finances and decline in Enron's core energy trading business left his company no choice but to walk away.\n\"This was a very difficult, complex, unprecedented decay of a company over many months,\" he said at a news conference. \"That's a shame, because (a merger) could have worked.\"\nDynegy announced the rescue plan Nov. 9, knowing that Enron posted a $618 million loss in third-quarter earnings and had ousted its chief financial officer for running partnerships that allowed the company to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating.\nBut that wasn't all.\nNov. 19 Enron filed paperwork with the SEC that restated its earnings back to 1997, eliminating more than $580 million in reported income in that time span. The filing also disclosed that Enron would have to pay a $690 million debt within a week.\nEnron got an extension for the debt, but its stock resumed a free-fall that had halted temporarily with the merger announcement. Dynegy started renegotiating Enron's sale price.\nAfter falling 85% Wednesday, shares of Enron were off another 25 cents, or 41 percent, to finish at 36 cents in extremely heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron's 52-week high was reached last December, at $84.88.\nWatson said surprises in the SEC filing caused irreparable damage, even as Dynegy continued to hammer away at an agreement.\nWhen two agencies cut Enron's credit rating to junk status Wednesday - triggering an obligation to pay debts of $3.9 billion, or nearly twice the cash the company is believed to have - Watson said he had to stop trying to save another company and protect his own.\nWatson said Dynegy invoked an escape clause in the merger agreement that allowed it to back out if Enron had serious financial problems, so Dynegy won't have to pay a $350 million breakup fee.\nHe also said Dynegy will acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline - which has 16,500 miles of pipelines from Texas to the Great Lakes - in exchange for the $1.5 billion part-Dynegy owner ChevronTexaco pumped into the ailing trader. \"Their pipeline operation is as good as any in the industry,\" Watson said. \"The real question is the wholesale operation, and the viability of that and how fast they can come back into the market.\"\nEnron may challenge that acquisition, but Watson said the tradeoff ensured ChevronTexaco wouldn't be out $1.5 billion.\n\"That pipeline will be Dynegy's Dec. 19,\" he said.\nRob Doty, Dynegy's chief financial officer, said Friday that because Dynegy is the pipeline's preferred stockholder, Northern Natural Gas cannot seek bankruptcy protection without Dynegy's approval.\nHe said the pipeline has been a separate subsidiary of Enron for more than 20 years. Dynegy will assume $950 million of Northern Natural Gas debt, Doty said.",

Brent Vasconcellos\nTax Attorney\nEnron Global Finance Tax\n1400 Smith Street EB 1759\nHouston, Texas 77002\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tKen Lay - Office of the Chairman\nSent:\tTuesday, November 13, 2001 6:15 PM\nTo:\tDL-GA-all_enron_worldwide1\nSubject:\tChange of Control Provisions\n\n\nAs many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.\n\nMany CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.\n\nI know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.\n\nThank you.",

    "body": "Mr Lay - If you really think that this sale creates a \"great opportunity\" for shareholders then you are more out of touch with reality than I previously thought (unless you were referring to Dynegy shareholders). Under your \"leadership\" the shareholders have been devastated, employees have lost their retirements, college funds have been desiminated and reputations have been ruined, including your own.\n\nWhile I applaud your forgoing of the $60 million dollar payment I suspect having taken it would have only added to outrage and probably weakend your position in forthcoming lawsuits and don't feel that it was as self efacing as you have lead us to believe . Under your direction Enron has promoted bafoons, charletons and incompetents to the highest management ranks.  You personally did everything imaginable to lose the confidence of the investment community, in my opinion. This has got to be the financial disaster of the decade, all under your direction.\n\nYou said Jeff Skilling left for \"personal reasons\" and there were not hidden financial problems. You told us you were becoming more transparent in financial disclosures and then tried to slip a $1.2 Billion dollar equity reduction by us. The list goes on and on. Why should we believe you now.\n\nOne more thing Mr. Lay. I suggest  take the listing of  \"executive awards\" off the internet site. I suspect new \"awards\" will be coming out soon. And please don't waste your time sending me self serving \"feel good\" memos anymore. I finally caught on to you.\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Deane Pierce/Corp/Enron on 11/14/2001 10:12 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nKen Lay - Office of the Chairman\n11/10/2001 07:17 AM\nSent by:\tGeneral Announcement\nTo:\tAll Enron Worldwide Distribution Group\ncc:\n\nSubject:\tEnron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy\n\nToday, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\n--\tThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\n--\tChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\n--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\n--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.",

For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\n--\tChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\n--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\n--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

While we will honor current\ncommitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to\nuse the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening\nis that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing\ndelegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.\n\nWe are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City\nCouncil that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of\nagreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by\nthe City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our\nBoard and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep\nus operating.\n\nI've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are\ndoing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed\ncontracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,\nif it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new\nyear begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be\ncomfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any\nchanges to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the\navailability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we\nhave already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our\nboilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying\nto do here.\n\nI Hope most of you will respond.

Of course there will continue to be\nvolatility, but we believe these higher gas prices are not only\nsustainable, but will likely move up through the summer (similar to what\nhappened in 2000). For the past two months it has become very evident that\nU.S. natural gas supply/demand on a weather-adjusted basis is much tighter\nthan the same time last year. The market has finally begun to realize the\nextent of this tightness, as more \"normal\" weather over the past several\nweeks has removed a substantial amount of the natural gas storage overhang.\nThis shift in supply/demand should become even more evident as we move into\nthe early part of the injection season in April/May. Look for summer gas\ninjections to be down 30% to 50% from last year's numbers. This should be\nthe bullish driver of summer natural gas prices.\n\nNext week, we should have even more bullish gas news, as the preliminary\nnumbers from our first quarter U.S. E&P production survey are likely to\nsurprise many on the Street.

It was the latest humiliation for the leading U.S. energy trader, which boasted US$100-billion in revenue and US$1-billion in profit last year, but whose shares lost US$26-billion in market value in less than two months because of accounting concerns.\n\"While uncertainty during the past few weeks has severely impacted the market's confidence in Enron and its trading operations, we are taking the steps announced today to help preserve capital, stabilize our businesses, restore the confidence of our trading counterparties, and enhance our ability to pay our creditors,\" Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Enron listed about US$24.7-billion in assets and US$13.1-billion in debts in court papers. The largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in history was Texaco Inc.'s US$35.9-billion filing in 1987.\nThe filing will allow Enron to continue operating while it negotiates a recovery plan with creditors, including the likely layoff of thousands of its 7,400 employees. It also blocks debt-collection efforts, lawsuits and other actions against the company.\nEnron, which is looking to obtain debtor-in- possession financing to let it carry on, also said it is suing Dynegy Inc. for US$10-billion.\nDynegy triggered the collapse when it backed out of a US$23-billion takeover bid for Enron last week. Dynegy balked after learning Enron had overstated earnings by US$580-million since 1997 and had debt in outside partnerships that reduced shareholder equity by US$1.2-billion.\nEnron's European arm went into bankruptcy last Thursday but it appears yesterday's filing did not cover its Canadian operation, Enron Canada Corp.\nCalls yesterday to the Calgary-based subsidiary were not returned but in an affidavit filed in an Alberta court Friday, Robson Milnthorp, president and chief executive of the Canadian subsidiary, said he had been told by the parent company's lawyers that Enron Canada and its affiliates would be not be covered by any U.S. filing.\nEnron Canada employs 143. It markets and trades electrical power and natural gas and has about $2.1-billion worth of contracts with hundreds of Canadian companies.\nMr. Milnthorp said in the affidavit that Enron Canada is a viable company on its own, but it needs time for advisors it has hired to negotiate with investors and potential buyers to recapitalize the firm.\nEnron Canada asked for a stay under the Canada Business Corporations Act to prevent its partners in Canada from cancelling contracts, which they are able to do because the parent company can no longer guarantee them.\n\"Under the current climate of market hysteria, it is important to quiet things down and permit Enron Canada to demonstrate its financial strength and ability to perform independently of Enron Corp.,\" Mr. Milnthorp pleaded.\nAlthough Justice D.G. Hart denied the stay, he told Enron to come back Wednesday once it had notified its Canadian partners of the application. Yesterday, however, a source familiar with the case said such a bid would be stillborn.\n\"If they try to do this application on Wednesday, there will be a ton of opposition. It will be almost impossible for them to get this order through,\" said the source, speaking before the Chapter 11 was announced.\nThe source said Enron Canada's only alternative may be to seek protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, although that may be of no help since such a filing could also trigger contract cancellations.\nEnron Corp.'s collapse leaves a global creditor list. Citigroup Inc., the largest U.S. financial services company, is owed US$3-billion from two loans and J.P. Morgan Chase's Chase Manhattan Bank is owed more than US$1.9-billion. In Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has a US$215-million exposure. Other Canadian banks downplayed or did not comment upon the situation last week.\nStandard & Poor's said banks and other financial institutions face losses of US$6.3-billion through credit derivatives.",

I have read about the heads of various companies and institutions, such as Railtrack here in the UK, taking large (huge) payments / payoffs / salaries while in charge of companies providing extremely poor levels of service and customer satisfaction.  After reading yesterday from various sources about the level of the provision in your contract I was extremely cynical.  After your voice mail / email this morning I am impressed and even uplifted.\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\n\nMark Fereday\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tKen Lay - Office of the Chairman\nSent:\t14 November 2001 00:18\nTo:\tDL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2\nSubject:\tChange of Control Provisions\n\n\nAs many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.\n\nMany CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.\n\nI know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.\n\nThank you.",

    "body": "My comments on the floating price source language follows:\n\nUS NG     BasisSwp Chicago  The floating price is shown to be equal to the\n\"monthly average\" price published in NGI's Bidweek        Survey.  The\nfloating price is more appropriately described as the \"Bidweek Average\"\nprice.  This        appears to be an oversight on Dynegydirect's part since\ntheir description for US NG     BasisSwp         SCalBrd correctly describes\nthe price as the \"bidweek average\" price.\nAny Gas Daily daily midpoint price description The floating price is shown to\nbe equal to the \"midpoint price published in the applicable issue\".\nGas        Daily is not published on weekends or holiday, therefore the\nquestion arises as to the pricing mechanism        Dynegydirect will use for\nthose days.  We add the phrase to our floating price description as follows\nto        answer that point:  \"if a calendar day is not a businress day then\nthe price for such day will be the Midpoint        price published on the\nnext succeeding business day\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Brent Hendry@ENRON on 11/29/2000 12:28 PM\nTo: Leslie Hansen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT\nSubject: DynegyDirect\n\nLeslie,\n\nThe following comments are with respect to all Basis Swap product\ndescriptions on the DynegyDirect trading web site.\n\n1.  The reference to the \"fixed price\" is incorrect as it references the\nbasis spread price specified on the trading screen rather than the second\nfloating price which should be one of the NYMEX futures contracts.  This is a\nstructural error that was carried through all the basis swap definitions and\nshould be fixed to avoid ambiguity or future arguments over what was\nintended.\n\n2.  In the new definition of \"fixed price\"  all references should be made to\neither the NYMEX Henry Hub or Permian Basin futures contracts for the\napplicable Determination Period rather than to the \"appropriate NYMEX futures\ncontract\".   Otherwise it will not be clear which natural gas futures\ncontract is being referred to.\n\n3.  While there is a default definition in the Master Agreement it would be\npreferable to define \"Determination Period\" in the product description by\nadding the following sentence, \"Each calendar month during the term of the\nTransaction will be a Determination Period.\"\n\n4.  The sentence specifying the definition of the \"Price\" should specify that\nthe \"Price is the differential between the Floating Price and the Fixed Price\n(or Fixed Price and the Floating Price).\n\n5.  The sentence relating to payment dates should specify that the amounts\nowed should be paid no later than \"five business days after the Floating\nPrice and the Fixed Price are published.\"\n\nI would suggest that Dynegy borrow the language from our long product\ndescriptions on EOL.\n\n\n\nThe following comments are with respect to the  \"FP Swap NYMEX\" product\ndescriptions.\n\n1.  In the definition of the \"floating price\" all references should be made\nto either the NYMEX Henry Hub or Permian Basin futures contract for the\napplicable Determination Period rather than to the \"appropriate NYMEX futures\ncontract\".   It is not clear which natural gas futures contract is being\nreferenced.\n\n2.  While there is a default definition in the Master Agreement it would be\npreferable to define \"Determination Period\" in the product description by\nadding the following sentence, \"Each calendar month during the term of the\nTransaction will be a Determination Period.\"\n\n\n\nAs we do not have a master agreement in place with Dynegy Liquids Marketing &\nTrade I would not approve trading in the liquids financial products including\nthe \"C2 Swap Fix OPIS C2 MON\" and \"NC4ISO Swap Fix OPIS NON MON\" products\nuntil either a master is agreed to or the GTC form of master is approved.\nPlease let us know if the commercial team wants to pursue trading these\nproducts.\n\n\nBob has agreed to review the definitions of the floating prices to ensure\nthat they correctly identify the floating price sources.  I will forward him\ncopies of the long form descriptions today.  Other than having Bob check the\nfloating price source language I do not have any comments on the two\nswingswap definitions.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or comments.\nRegards,\nBrent",

You have worked hard, probably worried many hours, and yes, probably played hard and enjoyed much and with the empire you have built will continue to live the rest of your life in luxury (a very enviable position to be in).\n\nWe are all where we are because of decisions we have made and your employees made their decision based on their best judgement call at the time.  Working for a company is like a marriage.  You put your faith, trust and confidence in the person of your choice and that person can change and put you through a lot of turmoil and grief, the same with the company you marry.  Employees will be able to recoop some of their savings once their stock has been converted to Dynegy.  I am not trying to change your mind about the money but want you to know that their are employees with feelings and a good mind to think things through and feel you are justified in accepting some reward for the dynasty you have helped to build.\n\nGood luck to you in the future.

    "body": "Dear Mr. Lay,\n\nI am one of many long time employees who has lost my life's savings and my kid's college fund.\n\nToday I am receiving my 15 Years of Service Award and having my Anniversary luncheon.  Would you like to attend?  My Department would appreciate a candid picture of how this could have happened to such a great company.  I have gone through tough times and many good times with Northern Natural Gas, InterNorth and Enron.  I was always so proud to be a part of this company.\n\nShould I have seen this coming?  I was just another sheep following and believing everything our leaders, Skilling, said regarding the probability of Enron's stock splitting.  I didn't play the market but looked at my 401K stock purchases as long term retirement and continued to put money into the 401K even when we (my family) were struggling to do so.\n\nI too grew up on a farm in Missouri.  I was raised under the same Midwest rooted values and the strict convictions of my father that you did not take charity or borrow money.  He also preached that to sue was not the way to correct a wrong.  I was always a little prideful that you too were a Midwesterner, with those rooted values of high integrity, compassion, and honesty.\n\nLife goes on.  I hope to continue my employment though all of this and will continue to be a great employee, only now for Dynegy.  This  is also a concern since I am in my late 40's.  My job, my kid's education, and my retirement weigh heavily along with the atmosphere we are all currently living in.\n\nThis reality is a struggle with many unanswered questions and devastating concerns for the future.\n\nI would appreciate your thoughts.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nRebecca Longoria\nGlobal Employee Services\nTel:  713-646-9679\nFax: 713-646-9501\nCell: 713-553-3901\nRebecca.Longoria@enron.com",

    "body": "Dear Mr. Chairman:\nThanks for your excellent leadership, generosity and thoughtfulness. It rem=\ninds me of a story of an old man who is walking along the beach early in th=\ne morning. As the tide is going out and sun is coming up, it gets lighter a=\nnd lighter and the old man spies a figure running along the beach, appearin=\ng to be dancing. When he finally gets close enough he sees that it's a youn=\ng boy, picking up star fish that he finds lying in the sand...throwing them=\nback into the ocean. \"What on earth are you doing?\", says the old man to t=\nhe boy. The boy stops and says, \"The tide is going out and soon the sun wil=\nl be high in the sky. These star fish will be stranded here in the hot sun =\nand if they're not put back in the water, they'll die.\" The old man looked =\nat the boy and looked at the beach. \"You have an impossible task ahead of y=\nou. The beach stretches on and on for miles. There are hundreds of starfish=\n. What possible difference can you make?\" The boy stooped down, picked up a=\nstar fish and flung it out into the water. Then he turned and looked at th=\ne old man and said, \"It made a difference to that one.\"=20\nYou've probably heard that story before...but... That's what it's all about=\n...making a difference. At the heart of every successful organization, ther=\ne are \"great people who do great things.\"=20\nThank you once again and we wish to have your continued leadership.\nBest Regards\nJitendra\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman =20\nSent:=09Tuesday, November 13, 2001 6:24 PM\nTo:=09DL-GA-ALL_enron_worldwide6\nSubject:=09Change of Control Provisions\n\n\nAs many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which pro=\nvides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my co=\nntract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dyneg=\ny, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this prov=\nision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 mon=\nths, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of sli=\nghtly more than $60 million.\n\nMany CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts a=\nnd mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances =\nfacing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought t=\nhese last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought =\nI would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take t=\nhe remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of empl=\noyees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would b=\ne for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, =\nI will receive no payments under this provision.\n\nI know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your famili=\nes face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power=\nto serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am s=\ntill very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue work=\ning with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightf=\nul place in the energy industry.\n\nThank you.",

I need your\nhelp to make sure I have \"Gore-like\" command of the details.  Please help\nwith the following information:\nEnron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any\npresentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we\nhave under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are\ncomfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever\ninformation you have.\nUpdated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information\nwas as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking\nfacilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.\nComparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from\nthe ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would\nbe nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already\napproved.\nCancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel\ncomfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of\nhow price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.\nISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is\nthere another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of\nthe PX report too.\nCEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information:\nproposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to\nexpedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less\nthan 10%)?\nSoft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the \"soft\" nature of\nthe cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it\nto say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting\nrequirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than\napplying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears\nthe market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?\nOffers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus\nany others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market\nwill provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility\n(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.\nHerding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be\ncourageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway\ncredible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else \"squishing\" on the\nprice cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need\nthese guys on board.\nThanks.",

Please see below.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Jan Smutny-Jones\nTo: Steven Kelly\nSent: Tuesday, November 21, 2000 1:22 PM\n\nThe ISO is reporting that there is 12,000 Mws of generating currently out of\nservice.  7,000 were scheduled outages.  5,000 Mws are forced outages.  The\nISO has called 3 Stage 2 emergencies over the last several days.  The\nsituation is critical.  IEP is aware that a number of its members maybe out\non scheduled maintenance.  It would be extremely helpful if maintenance is\nexpedited and units returned to service as soon as possible.\n\nThe IEP membership has always been helpful in meeting California's energy\nneeds in time of crisis.  Historically this has involved Seismic .The events.\nThe current crisis is weather driven but none the less real.  Let's keep\nthose Christmas lights on.  If you are getting anything less than full\ncooperation from your local utility please advise us as soon as possible.\nThank you for your assistance.\nJan Smutny-Jones\nExecutive Director\nIndependent Energy Producers\n1112  \"I\" St, Ste. 380\nSacramento, CA  95814\nPh. 916-448-9499\nFx. 916-448-0182",

Several IEP members have offered (and have\ncontinued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current\nretail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant\nto enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We\nwill point out that several different independent entities have agreed that\nlong-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act\nimmediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness\nreview that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term\nfixed contracts.\n\nIEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the\nPress Conference.\n\nWe would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show\nthat there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term\nfixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if\nyou are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as\nwe are sending out an advisory on Monday.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nKatie Kaplan\nManager of State Policy Affairs\nIndependent Energy Producers Association\n(916) 448-9499",

    "body": "I heard your decision on channel 13 this morning as I was dressing for work. I was not moved by your gesture to give your contractual monetary provisions back to the company who would be Dynegy when this is all said and done. If you are sincere about wanting to help Enron, then helping the people who have made Enron what it is today would be a  more appropriate gesture. Clearly you know that Dynegy's employees will be given higher consideration for jobs than Enron employees will. The company will be dismantled and so will our lives.\n\nThe road to Enron was not an easy one, and  my  decision to seek employment here was difficult in light of the way Enron is portrayed in the back offices of the energy industry.  Enron is said to be a sweatshop, a backstabbing work environment and that the executive levels of management at Enron fuel, foster and support this type of mentality. I have worked in various commercial capacities, and I came to Enron with the hope  that times had changed, and  that the thriving energy industry had taken Enron to another stratosphere, and I was right! I love my job because the work environment is conducive to a mature and intelligent exchange of information and growth potential.\n\nJust when you believe you are among the most intelligent, there is always someone who comes along with more real world application, with common sense and integrity added. Hiring intelligent people is a great practice, but I've worked with the best and the brightest in many companies so Enron is no exception. Hiring the best and the brightest obviously was the downside to Enron's demise. It appears  that there is a thin line between intelligence and arrogance and Enron appears to have stepped over that line.\n\nDue to what you called \"mistakes in judgement'\", my future here is uncertain, as is that of my my co-workers. Many are agonizing about their families futures as well. I have survived a corporate merger, bankruptcy and buyouts with a number of companies specifically, Texaco, Columbia Energy Group and Amoco.  During all of this I continued to hold my head high and to provide the same level of service during these transitions, so that at the end of the day my self esteem and integrity would be intact.\n\nYes, we can and will all find other jobs, just as the many other recently unemployed people in this hurting economy will.  Everyone speaks to the loss of investor confidence, class action lawsuits and corporate losses, but who speaks out for the employees affected by the actions of a few. We were robbed of our hope, and the expectation of doing a good job and reaping the benefits. The investors and the employees here were kept in the dark, and  the powers that be have just sold us down the river and for what? For a handful of people to get richer.\n\nRationalizing and trying to bargain the behavior of those who are at fault for this catastrophe is just wrong. Taking it to a level where you somehow convince yourself that everything that has happened to date is okay, is just wrong. Companies merge, are bought out and collapse every day due to mismanagement, industry nose dives and economic slow downs. But please tell me how a company in just a few weeks, can go from a powerhouse to a beggar on the streets of downtown Houston?\n\n\nTruthfully,\n\nNot just merely a whiner, but a long suffering Gas Industry Specialist.\n\nCynthia Boseman-Harris",

Several IEP members have offered (and have\ncontinued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current\nretail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant\nto enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We\nwill point out that several different independent entities have agreed that\nlong-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act\nimmediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness\nreview that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term\nfixed contracts.\n\nIEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the\nPress Conference.\n\nWe would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show\nthat there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term\nfixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if\nyou are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as\nwe are sending out an advisory on Monday.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nKatie Kaplan\nManager of State Policy Affairs\nIndependent Energy Producers Association\n(916) 448-9499",

Another \"group\" to which I believe\nthat we should emphasize our marketing efforts includes the online trading\nplatforms.\n\nThree types of online trading platforms presently exist: (1)proprietary\nexchanges (EnronOnline, Dynegydirect); (2) consortium platforms (ICEX); and\n(3) independent, third-party platform (Altra) [these platforms are similar\nto (2)but differ in that the shareholders/backers have not committed\nliquidity].  The volumes traded on these types of electric platforms are\nsignificant and growing.  According to MegawattDaily, Ameren Energy\nconducts\nabout 40% of next-day deals and 30% of forwards on various electronic\nplatforms.  There are presently close to 25 platforms (of course, with so\nmany competitors, as usually happens, there will probably be a weeding out\nand/or consolidations/mergers...the Jurassic period notwithstanding, as\nblame for the mass dinosaur extinction lay with an errant meteor or\npossibly\nthe taking up of cigarette smoking by the majority of the dinosaurs\naccording to Larsen...all apologies for the joke).\n\nAs each platform system has different definitions, products, and contracts,\nand as several of the platforms are considering adopting standard\ncontracts,\nI believe an opportunity exists to push the EEI as either the exclusive\nstandard agreement used for trading on a particular platform or as a\ndefault\nagreement for those proprietary and other platforms under which trading\npartners lack executed Masters with the counterparty.  In fact, according\nto\npublished sources, Houston Street, RedMeteor, and others have been working\nwith others for several months on developing industry standards.\n\nJust a thought.\n\nBabak\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Andy Katz [mailto:AKatz@eei.org]\nSent: Thursday, October 26, 2000 3:54 PM\nTo: fmdutton@aep.com; hemu@dynegy.com; elizabeth.sager@enron.com;\nbbrou91@entergy.com; mroger3@entergy.com; wfhenze@jonesday.com;\ndperlman@powersrc.com; rosteen@powersrc.com; drusso@reliantenergy.com;\npdondanville@schiffhardin.com; babak.pooya@southernenergy.com\nSubject: Oct 13 Meeting Follow-Up\n\n\nSome random thoughts:\n\nThere was a teleconference today regarding the credit annex.  Bill McCoy\nshould have draft language by early next week.  This draft only addresses\nEEI transactions, but could easily be expanded to transactions under other\nmaster agreements.  I will circulate Bill's draft as soon as I get it.\nRandy Baker & Michelle McLendin (Duke), and Lisa Grof & Frank Hilton (AEP)\nhave volunteered to work on the on the credit annex subcommittee.\n\nAccording to my notes, assignments for the remaining optional provisions\nare\nas follows:\n\n1) Incorporating old  trades - Elizabeth\n2) One-way transactions - Buddy\n3) New products e.g. Western Firm/CAISO - Dede & Elizabeth\n4) Regulatory Out - John Crespo & Randy Osteen\n5) New taxes - Fritz\n6) ADR - Patty\n7) Agency relationship - Elizabeth\n8) Electronic Exchanges - Babak\n\nAdditional provisions\n9) Credit Annex - Bill McCoy, et al.\n10) incorporating prior trades not under netting, Frank Stllingwerf\n11) Broker Confirmations ?\n12) Over Deliveries - Phyliss Lemel\n\nWhat kind of deadline for these assignments is realistic?\n\nRandy Osteen & I plan to meet next w/ week to start planning the workshop\nin\nAtlanta we plan to hold at the end of January.

I called Smutney last week re this press conference and declined.  I said\nthat the idea is fine and we support it, but Enron does not want to\nparticipate in a press conference with other generators on this topic.\n\n2. I just talked to Rob Lamkin of Southern who indicated that ten companies\nhave gotten letters from Gov Davis addressed to \"Dear CEO of Energy\nCompany.\"  Letter was to invite these companies to attend a meeting on\nMonday, December 1 in LA.  Agenda and issues to follow, but Rob thought it\nhad to do with the Gov's plan for CA due 12/1.  Meeting will not be with\nDavis, but with his staff.  Southern is deciding who to send.  Reliant will\nsend John Stout and Curtis Keebler.  Williams got a letter, but no info re\ntheir rep.  Rob was calling to see if we got a letter and, if we did, out\nthoughts re meeting before the Gov's meeting to discuss.  I said we could\nhave gotten a letter, but I did not know.\n\n\n\n----- Forwarded by David Parquet/SF/ECT on 11/21/2000 04:38 PM -----\n\n\"Katie Kaplan\" <kaplan@iepa.com>\n11/21/2000 04:07 PM\nPlease respond to kaplan\n\nTo: <Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com>, <knorton@mcnallytemple.com>, \"'John Stout for\nReliant'\" <john_h_stout@reliantenergy.com>, \"'Curtis Keebler at Reliant'\"\n<curtis_l_kebler@reliantenergy.com>, \"'Julie @ Edson'\" <jmball@ns.net>,\n\"'Paula Hall-Collins'\" <paula.hall-collins@williams.com>, \"'Marty Wilson'\"\n<mwilson@pstrategies.com>, \"'Rob Lamkin'\" <rllamkin@seiworldwide.com>, \"Karen\nEdson\" <kedson@ns.net>, \"Bob Weisenmiller\" <rbw@mrwassoc.com>, \"Sue Mara\"\n<smara@enron.com>, \"Andy Brown\" <abb@eslawfirm.com>, \"B Brown Andy\"\n<andybrwn@earthlink.net>, \"Bob Escalante\" <rescalante@riobravo-gm.com>, \"Greg\nBlue\" <gtbl@dynegy.com>, \"Jack Pigott\" <jackp@calpine.com>, \"Jan\nSmutny-Jones\" <smutny@iepa.com>, \"Joe Ronan\" <joer@calpine.com>, \"Karen\nDenne\" <kdenne@enron.com>, \"Karen Edson\" <kedson@ns.net>, \"Kassandra Gough\"\n<kgough@calpine.com>, \"Kristin Vellandi\" <kvellandi@pstrategies.com>, \"Lynn\nLednicky\" <lale@dynegy.com>, \"McNally Ray\" <rmcnally@mcnallytemple.com>,\n\"Paula Hall-Collins\" <paula.hall-collins@williams.com>, \"Richard Hyde\"\n<rwhyde@duke-energy.com>, \"Rob L.

Several IEP members have offered (and have\ncontinued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current\nretail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant\nto enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We\nwill point out that several different independent entities have agreed that\nlong-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act\nimmediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness\nreview that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term\nfixed contracts.\n\nIEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the\nPress Conference.\n\nWe would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show\nthat there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term\nfixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if\nyou are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as\nwe are sending out an advisory on Monday.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nKatie Kaplan\nManager of State Policy Affairs\nIndependent Energy Producers Association\n(916) 448-9499",

    "subject": "Overview of Investor Conference Call",
    "date": "Wed, 14 Nov 2001 19:26:42 -0800 (PST)",
    "body": "Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =\nof the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.\n\nWe told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=\nests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=\ny, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=\nss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.\n\nIt took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =\nof significant events that led to our current situation:\n\n-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=\nre businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=\nrix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=\nr imagined when we made these investments;\n\n-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=\nny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=\ntensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;\n\n-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=\nvestor confidence, which has been very damaging;\n\n-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=\nstand financial and operating disclosures; and\n\n-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=\niscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=\nusly reported earnings.\n\nWe've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=\nareas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.\n\nCore Businesses\n\nOur core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=\nnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=\nese include:\n\n-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;\n\n-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;\n\n-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and\n\n-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.\n\nThe events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=\nr projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=\nme what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=\nthese actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=\n.\n\nI also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =\nof weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =\nconcerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=\nmprovement in our counterparty relationships.\n\nNon-Core Businesses\n\nOur non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=\nivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=\nreturn from them has been dismal.\n\nWe have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =\nthat the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=\nthat we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=\nady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=\ney include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=\nG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=\ns properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=\nis also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.\n\nBusinesses Under Review\n\nThese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=\ns wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=\neral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=\nrmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=\nicient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.\n\nReviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=\nreductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=\necomes available.\n\nCredit Rating/10-Q Filing\n\nWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =\nour liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=\nlance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=\nedit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:\n\n-- Moody's at Baa3       \"Under Review for Further Downgrade\"\n\n-- Fitch at BBB-             \"Evolving Status\"\n\n-- S&P at BBB-              \"CreditWatch Negative\"\n\nWe also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=\nand Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=\n0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =\n19.\n\nWe will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=\nll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =\ncall will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =\nfew days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=\nstors under \"SEC Filings.\"\n\n=20\n\n=20\n\nIn connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =\njoint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=\nn. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=\nxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=\navailable, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=\ncurity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=\nus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =\nDynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=\nies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=\ne incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=\no be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=\n, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =\n507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=\nilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=\n713) 646-3302.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=\ndered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=\nn connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=\nirect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=\nle in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.",

Thanks\n\n\n\n\"J. ROBERT NELSON\" <JRNELSON@LLGM.COM>\n04/18/2001 12:57 PM\n\nTo: Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com\ncc: CEKLUND@LLGM.COM\nSubject: Power Exchange\n\n\nThe Committee interviewed financial advisors yesterday.  The list included\nPriceWaterhouse, KPMG, BDO, Stonefield Josephson and Neilson, Elggren.  The\npreference seemed to be PW, in major part because it was actively involved in\ncreation of the Power Exchange systems.  There was an obvious concern about\nthe potential for conflicts given PW's role for the PGE committee.  In that\nregard, we were told (1) that there is a different standard for accountants\nthan attorneys, (2) that counsel for the PGE committee didn't perceive a\nproblem, (3) that there would be different teams handling each of the cases,\n(4) that it was highly unlikely that there would be any disagreement over the\nunderlying numbers (ie, that PW would at the same time be supporting and\nchallenging numbers in claims litigation).  We've asked PW for assurances\nthat if there is any challenge, it will be available to support the\nparticipants' position.  We're waiting for a response.  For the moment, no\nsecond choice has been identified.\nBefore the interviews, I spoke with Marc Cohen.  He's frustrated with Joe\nEisenberg.  Joe has been slow in generating a stipulation to transfer\nlitigation responsibility to the participants committee.  Consequently, Cohen\nwent ahead and drafted a stipulation himself.  Evidently Eisenberg is about\nto sign off, and the matter will be presented to the court presumably on\nshortened time.  I took the opportunity to urge Cohen to press Eisenberg to\nprepare a liquidating plan.  In that regard, Eisenberg did go to the\ncreditors committee and propose using $4 million of the $20 million of\navailable cash to support a plan.  Not surprisingly, the creditors came back\nasking for $18 million.  Cohen's sense is that there may be a deal in the $10\nmillion range, particularly if we can persuade the trade that the\nparticipants may themselves have a claim against the $20 million.  Cohen is\ngiving thought to how we make that case.  If we can agree on a number, we can\nget rid of the trade creditors, shift responsibility for the wind up to a\nliquidating agent of our choosing and close the bankruptcy case.\nCohen apparently has made no headway in efforts to reconstitute the PGE\ncommittee.  He's concerned that the second largest creditor does not have a\nseat at the table and questions whether the presence of such entities as\nEnron and Dynegy adequately represents the interests of the broad range of\nPower Exchange participants.  Wearing our CPX committee hat and the duty that\ncomes with that, are we comfortable leaving things as they are rather than\nencouraging our counsel to pursue the matter with some formal motion in the\nPGE case?  Unless I hear to the contrary, I'll assume that our position in\nthat regard has not changed and that if there were a committee vote on that\nparticular issue, we'd abstain.\nI see that some efforts may be underway to compel the Power Exchange to\nrelease collateral.  Is that something we'd consider joining?

    "body": "Seab/Sabine,\n\nSorry for the delay in getting back to you on this important issue.  The\nthree rule changes or designs in other markets you describe look very good\nand are right on point.  I would like to add two more to your list, namely:\n\n1) Price caps in California\n\nAttached is a one page memo from my colleague in California, Jeff Dasovich.\nConsistent with Jeff's first two points, Steve Kean has told me that in\naddition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps, and\nthe uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  The turbine\nmarket is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their\nown capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in\njurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other\nthan the operation of the market.  Several generators, including Dynegy and\nCalpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have\nordered.  I have a Nov 10, 2000 Megawatt Daily article that quotes Enron and\nCalpine as saying that price caps in California drove both companies to\nwithdraw proposed plants.\n\nI recognize there is presently no price cap proposal in Alberta but I think\nwe can draw the connection between interference through caps and interference\nthrough other forms of administrative intervention that are being considered\nin Alberta such as: 1) price discrimination on imports, or 2) the latest\nproposal I heard today from the Power Pool which is capping import offers\ninto the Power Pool at Mid-C prices plus tranmission costs.\n\n\n\n2) FERC Staff Report on Midwest that apparently states on pages 2-15 that\nsome market participants believe that developers sited new generation in the\nMidwest because there were no price caps (see attached FERC Report).\n\n\n\nAs we discussed, I will be using this information in upcoming meetings (this\nFriday is the next one) with the Power Pool and the Alberta Gov't in support\nof Enron's arguments that policy makers in Alberta must \"stay the course\"\nthrough the higher priced periods, failing which they will make things much\nworse.\n\nIn view of the fact it is U.S. Thanksgiving could you please give me a sense\nof Sabine's timing on this.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Seabron Adamson\" <seabron.adamson@frontier-economics.com> on 11/20/2000\n10:39:39 AM\nTo: <Robert.Hemstock@enron.com>\ncc: \"Sabine Schnittger\" <sabine.schnittger@frontier-economics.com>, \"Kevin.\nWellenius\" <kevin.wellenius@frontier-economics.com>\nSubject: Outline memo for paper on rules changes in other markets\n\n\n\nRob:\n\nPlease see attached.

Present were Don Sevrens, news\neditor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek,\neditorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the\nreporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer.\n\nMy two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is\nworking elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in\nCalifornia if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply\nshortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and\nexpediting the permitting process.  I was subtly trying to get across the\nmessage that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to\nreconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their\npower supply and demand into balance.  I, of course, defended FERC's order on\nthe causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack\nof any authority to order retroactive refunds.  I also pointed out that there\nwere no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be\nwarranted even if there was legal authority.  I also pointed out the problems\nwith price caps.\n\nOther than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others\nasked good questions and seemed to be listening.  They made the point\nrepeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political\ncompromise with the generators/marketers is necessary.  One of them said he\nhad heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me\nmy position.  I responded that I had no response.  Anything like that is the\nbusiness of individual members.\n\nThey indicated that they expected to do a story for this coming Sunday's\nInsight Section.  Please give me any feedback you have.\n\ncc:  Stu Ryan, AES by fax\nJim Macias, Calpine, by fax",

TVA made a presentation at the last meeting of the subcommittee.  I will forward to you an outline of their comments.\n\nPlease take a look at them and provide me with comments on how you think the industry should respond and who you think should do it (i.e. should we have EPSA testify, a panel of industry experts, etc...).  I will be on the EPSA call Friday afternoon.\n\nFor those of you who are not aware, Enron has site near Memphis that it is developing.  The air permit application was submitted prior to the Chief of Staff's letter advising local air boards to not accept new permits.  We tentatively believe that our permit can go forward w/o holdup.   While our site might be spared, we need to take into consideration the fact that the state could take action to severely limit independent power projects in TN.  This action could result in a domino effect in the south.  Also, this meeting provides us with an opportunity to bring our message regarding TVA into Tennessee.\n\nI will also obtain a copy of the subcommittee's members and forward it to you.\n\nAlso, Robert Gowan of Stokes Bartholomew, one of our law firms in TN, is talking with the head of the EWG about getting EPSA appointed to the Advisory Board of the Working Group.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \t\"Samantha Slater\" <sslater@epsa.org>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Samantha+20Slater+22+20+3Csslater+40epsa+2Eorg+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]\nSent:\tWednesday, September 26, 2001 9:23 AM\nTo:\tdlimbac@alleghenyenergy.com; tadlhoc@alleghenyenergy.com; zaiontj@bp.com; jconnelly@calpine.com; jflumerfelt@calpine.com; pmoeller@calpine.com; Dennis.Flaherty@Cinergy.COM; Jason.Barker@Cinergy.COM; jeffreeman@cogentrix.com; Paula_Soos@CovantaEnergy.com; carolyn_moss@dom.com; mshaywood@duke-energy.com; David.Cruthirds@dynegy.com; Jenni.Barr@ElPaso.com; Jacoby, Ben; bhueter@enron.com; Shelk, John; Beth.Bradley@mirant.com; scott.omalia@mirant.com; jane.cahill@neg.pge.com; leah.gibbons@neg.pge.com; melissa.lavinson@neg.pge.com; bryan.riley@nrgenergy.com; james.hebson@pseg.com; Kristen.Ludecke@pseg.com; ben.boyd@reliant.com; bud_albright@reliant.energy.com; chris_m_giblin@reliantenergy.com; jlsena@tecoenergy.com; jmartin@TENASKA.com; bcox@tnsk.com; achau@tractebelpowerinc.com; Dwight.Rychel@Williams.com; Gretchen.Emling@Williams.com\nCc:\tAndrea Spring; Jodi Empol\nSubject:\tMtg. in Nashville on October 18\n\nThe meeting with the Committee will be held in Nashville on October 18th.

Interventions are due Sept. 12 and Sept. 18, respectively.\n\nRecently, IEP forwarded a Restructuring/Transmission Task Force\nsolicitatation seeking to raise funds to help fund IEP's intervention in\nmatters such as this.  To date, IEP has received two responses.  In the\nabsence of significant funding, IEP will be unable to utilize consultants to\nhelp in the monitoring and filing of interventions in\nrestructuring/transmission matters.  We will endeavor to continue to keep\nthe members apprised of key issues through the use of in-house staff, but\nresources will be limited and may make the preparation and filing of\ninterventions difficult.  For example, IEP is unlikely to file an\nintervention at the FERC in response to the EOB and CALPX filings given time\nand resource constraints.\n\nIf you are interested in funding additional support in this effort, please\nrespond ASAP to the solicitation distributed in August.

    "body": "As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.\n\nMany CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.\n\nI know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.\n\nThank you.",

When implemented, scheduled for June 2000, this will=\n=20\nprovide one stop shopping for next hour business.  Ties OASIS and TAGGING=\n=20\ntogether into one request.  Also if a tranmission provider cuts the=20\ntransmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally=\n=20\nscheduled. This will speed up the ability to schedule the next hour=20\nnon-firm.  This order is an important recognition by FERC that its OATT did=\n=20\nnot cover hourly, which we complained about alot at FERC's hotline last=20\nsummer.\n\n2)  Successful in obtaining the release of all ISN (system information) to=\n=20\nmarketers in the WSCC region.  This was an individual effort by Dick that h=\nas=20\nbeen benificial for our traders in the WEST.  Successfully prevented the WS=\nCC=20\nOperating Committee from taking action that would have reversed this effort=\n. =20\n\n3)  Assisted in getting the initial control areas in SERC approved last ye=\nar=20\nand preventing ATC changes this year and OC changes that would have negated=\n=20\nthe Control Area effort.\n\n4)  Dick served as Co CHAIR of the ISO committee that put the SPP contract=\n=20\nin place that eliminated MW mile pricing in SPP and will serve as the basis=\n=20\nfor SPP's RTO.  =20\n\n5) Dick was appointed to the NERC Control Area Task Force which was formed=\n=20\nas a result of our the success of the Enron Control Areas in TVA and have s=\no=20\nfar been successful in keeping this effort so that it is non punitive.  Thi=\ns=20\nhas turned into a very positive process that may result in a new=20\nconfiguration of the NERC relibiability effort.\n\n(6) Dick's made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing=\n=20\ntheir new scheduling procedure (ultimate source and sink) with FERC.  This=\n=20\nwas initially going to be implemented unilaterally March 1 without a FERC=\n=20\nfiling and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint=20\nsituation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav=\ne=20\nincurred in the meantime (See Comm. Massey's concurrence in Aquila v. Enter=\ngy=20\nabout the lack of incentive to file complaints).  Kevin Presto said that=20\nwinning the protest at FERC (due 4/12) would be worth $100 MM.\n\n(7)  On 2/2, TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from=20\nminute by minute to hourly accountability (notably, TECO revised its propos=\nal=20\nbefore FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein.) We worked wi=\nth=20\nEPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECO=01,s proposal.  We didn=01,t like TECO=\n's=20\nproposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name=\n=20\n(since Enron is working with TECO on a project).   We were able to get EPSA=\n=20\nto protest this issue in TECO's initial filing.  Enron is planning to site=\n=20\ngeneration in Florida, but we don't have the value on this win yet.\n\n(8)  FERC issued a NOPR on January 28 proposing to revise the=\n=20\nway it assesses annual charges to public utilities.  Enron, along with=20\nseveral other participants (Dynegy, Koch, APX, Citizens, NP Energy, Sonat a=\nnd=20\nWilliams), filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August, 1998,=20\nrequesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges,=20\narguing that FERC's current system of assessing annual charges on sales for=\n=20\nresale of power discourages trading, impedes reliance on competitive market=\ns=20\nfor power, and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new=\n=20\npower marketers entering the market.  We proposed that FERC either assess i=\nts=20\ncosts on transmission only, or reallocate the amounts that it collects=20\nthrough sales transactions versus transmission transactions.  Although FERC=\n=20\ndoes not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot, the petition=\n=20\nserved its purpose.\n\nIn the NOPR, FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on=20\ntransmission issues (a point that we made in the Petition), it is appropria=\nte=20\nto assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat=\ne=20\ncommerce by public utilities.  Under the current assessment system, FERC=20\ndivides its costs between transmission and sales.  Now FERC is proposing to=\n=20\ncollect its costs solely through transmission.  FERC justifies this change=\n=20\nbecause it spends most of its time on transmission issues, and because=20\ntransmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges=20\nassessed to users of the grid.  FERC proposes to asses its costs to 1)=20\nunbundled wholesale transmission; 2) unbundled retail transmission; and 3)=\n=20\nbundled wholesale power sales.  Bundled native load transactions will=20\napparently avoid assessments of any FERC-related costs; however, EPSA and=\n=20\nEnron are protesting this issue at FERC.  (Jim Steffes has been working on =\na=20\ncalculation of additional value.)\n\n(9)  Interconnection Policy =01) Utilizing EPSA efforts, including Sarah's=\n=20\nmeeting with FERC, we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth (=\nin=20\nthe forum we suggested, i.e., an existing proceeding) in the Tennessee Powe=\nr=20\norder where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form=\na=20\ntariff, including that a generator doesn't have to request transmission and=\n=20\ninterconnection at the same time.

    "date": "Wed, 14 Nov 2001 19:29:29 -0800 (PST)",
    "body": "Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =\nof the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.\n\nWe told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=\nests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=\ny, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=\nss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.\n\nIt took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =\nof significant events that led to our current situation:\n\n-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=\nre businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=\nrix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=\nr imagined when we made these investments;\n\n-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=\nny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=\ntensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;\n\n-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=\nvestor confidence, which has been very damaging;\n\n-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=\nstand financial and operating disclosures; and\n\n-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=\niscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=\nusly reported earnings.\n\nWe've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=\nareas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.\n\nCore Businesses\n\nOur core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=\nnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=\nese include:\n\n-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;\n\n-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;\n\n-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and\n\n-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.\n\nThe events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=\nr projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=\nme what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=\nthese actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=\n.\n\nI also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =\nof weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =\nconcerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=\nmprovement in our counterparty relationships.\n\nNon-Core Businesses\n\nOur non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=\nivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=\nreturn from them has been dismal.\n\nWe have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =\nthat the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=\nthat we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=\nady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=\ney include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=\nG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=\ns properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=\nis also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.\n\nBusinesses Under Review\n\nThese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=\ns wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=\neral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=\nrmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=\nicient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.\n\nReviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=\nreductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=\necomes available.\n\nCredit Rating/10-Q Filing\n\nWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =\nour liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=\nlance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=\nedit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:\n\n-- Moody's at Baa3       \"Under Review for Further Downgrade\"\n\n-- Fitch at BBB-             \"Evolving Status\"\n\n-- S&P at BBB-              \"CreditWatch Negative\"\n\nWe also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=\nand Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=\n0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =\n19.\n\nWe will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=\nll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =\ncall will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =\nfew days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=\nstors under \"SEC Filings.\"\n\n=20\n\n=20\n\nIn connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =\njoint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=\nn. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=\nxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=\navailable, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=\ncurity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=\nus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =\nDynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=\nies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=\ne incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=\no be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=\n, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =\n507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=\nilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=\n713) 646-3302.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=\ndered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=\nn connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=\nirect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=\nle in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.",

Please note, the\nworkshops will start promptly at 9:00 a.m. each day, and end around 4:00\np.m.  Among other things, these slightly longer sessions allow time for\nfeedback from the parties.  With this earlier start, we will provide a\ncontinental breakfast as well as lunch on both days.  The Workshop will be\nheld at PG&E's headquarters, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco.  We will be in\nConference Room 308 on Tuesday, and Conference Room 300 on Wednesday.\n\nPlease RSVP to Darcy Morrison, at e-mail D2Mr@pge.com, or by telephone at\n(415) 973-6644, so that we can get a head-count for the meals.\n\nAttached below is our proposed agenda for the November 7-8 Workshop.  The\ntopics include:  demand-supply forecast, supply reliability, capital cost\nforecast, and backbone direct connection and local transmission rate design\noptions.  Although these subjects have been discussed at prior workshops,\nour objective is to present additional detail and analysis so we can all\nwrestle with some key issues and begin to formulate possible solutions.\n\nAlso, as we discussed at the last Workshop, we have set aside two hours at\nthe end of each day for observations and feedback from the parties.  Along\nwith the issues list, this will help PG&E to put together a proposal that\nseeks to balance the many competing interests.\n\nThis is our last scheduled Workshop before we send out our first version of\na settlement proposal.  Our target date for this proposal remains December\n8.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you next week.

Both SoCalGas and PG&E sent a letter and email to to the\nfull service list yesterday (Tues, 9/5) informing parties of this development.\n\nSoCalGas believes that some modification to the Comprehensive Settlement in\nnecessary to take this development into account, and that we then need to\nfile the modification as soon as possible with the Commission.? The ALJ has\nindicated to us that some formal filing with the Commission in response to\nthis development will be necessary.\n\nWe want to work with the signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement to reach\na consensus as soon as possible.? Our goal is to cause little or no delay in\nthe processing of a decision on the Comprehensive Settlement.\n\nWhat SoCalGas has in mind is modifying the settlement to remove the specific\nnaming of Altra and to insert language saying that SoCalGas will select and\ncontract with a third-party provider for a specified period of time, without\nidentifying in the settlement who that will be.?? We also need to consider\nwhether we should address in the revision to the settlement how we will\nhandle the possibility that the third-party provider will not be ready to\noperate by the April 1, 2001 date the settlement provides for the monthly\nimbalance trading, OFO day imbalance chip trading, and storage rights\ntrading.? SoCalGas is looking at interim arrangements that it could provide\nin-house starting April 1, 2001, until the third-party provider could begin\nservice.? We also might consider what would happen if no third party provider\ncan be found.\n\nTo avoid any claims that we have not complied with the settlement rules,\ntoday we mailed and emailed to the full service list a notice of a settlement\nconference for Wednesday of next week.? We want to file something with the\nCommission very promptly thereafter.\n\nPlease feel free to contact Glen Sullivan at 619-699-5027, Lad Lorenz at\n213-244-3820, Bob Betonte at 213-244-3832, or June Suwara at 213-244-3504 on\nthis subject.?\n\nFor those of you who have not heard, Brian Cherry has submitted his\nresignation from Sempra Energy's Regulatory Affairs Dept. and will be going\nto work shortly for PG&E in a similar capacity.",

    "subject": "Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy",
    "date": "Fri, 9 Nov 2001 15:52:04 -0800 (PST)",
    "body": "Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\n--\tThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\n--\tChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\n--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\n--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.",

In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.

I hope we still have someone who can do that.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nStacy\nx3-5705\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mann, Kay\nSent: Tuesday, February 26, 2002 7:02 PM\nTo: Dickson, Stacy E.\nSubject: FW: Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan\n\n\nDo you know the answer to the tax question, or at least who to ask?\n\nThanks,\n\nKay\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Germany, Chris\nSent: Tue 2/26/2002 5:46 PM\nTo: Germany, Chris; McMichael Jr., Ed; Concannon, Ruth; Boyt, Eric; Garza, Maria; Polsky, Phil; Dicarlo, Louis; Olinger, Kimberly S.; Parks, Joe; Mann, Kay\nCc: Fowler, Kulvinder; Schumack, Sherlyn\nSubject: Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan\n\n\n\nOpps.

(an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, \"Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months\".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.\n\nTomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will\n\n1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to\n2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.\n\nKay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.

    "body": "To:  OII Agreement Settling Parties\n\nAttached for your review and comment is a draft advice filing in\nwhich PG&E proposes to reduce the in-kind shrinkage allowances for on-system\ntransmission and distribution service to the level proposed in PG&E's 2000\nBiennial Cost Allocation Proceeding (BCAP).  PG&E's current adopted\nshrinkage allowances require customers to deliver more in-kind shrinkage gas\nthan is actually needed on PG&E's pipeline system.  Reducing shrinkage\nallowances to the proposed levels in PG&E's 2000 BCAP will more accurately\nreflect currently projected customer usage.  PG&E is requesting your review\nand support of this adjustment to shrinkage allowances.  October 1, 2000, is\nthe target implementation date.\n\nPG&E is continuing to study ways to better manage shrinkage on its\nsystem. For this purpose, PG&E is examining the mechanisms used by other\npipelines.  If the Company determines that further proposals should be\nimplemented, such as a true-up mechanism to adjust for the over- and\nunder-collection of shrinkage that has occurred since the beginning of the\nGas Accord, or which may occur in the future, it may file for such proposals\nthrough a separate mechanism.  As with this filing, PG&E will seek your\ninput prior to making any official advice filing.\n\nPlease provide any comments on the attached no later than Friday,\nJuly 7, 2000, to Ms. Cynthia Crane by e-mail at CMC5@PGE.com or in writing\nto PG&E, Mail Code N15A, P.O. Box 770000, San Francisco, CA  94177.  If\ncomments are favorable, PG&E will file this advice filing the third week of\nJuly with a proposed implementation date of October 1, 2000.  Please contact\nMs. Cynthia Crane at (415) 973-5809 if you have any questions.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDan Thomas\nManager, California Gas Transmission\n\n\n<<ALShrinkage_LTR>>\n\n- ALShrinkage_LTR.doc",

    "date": "Fri, 6 Apr 2001 04:29:00 -0700 (PDT)",
    "body": "Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power\nto the state, a U.S. court rules.\nBy Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton\nBEE STAFF WRITERS\n(Published April 6, 2001)\nIn a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a\nfederal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order\nthat a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state\nwithout guarantee of payment.\nState energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but\ncould precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant\noff-line for maintenance.\nOn March 21, citing \"rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California\nlandscape,\" U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction\nagainst Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators.\nHouston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20\npercent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found\nthat loss of that production \"poses an imminent threat.\"\nBut Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\ngranted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown \"a high\nlikelihood of success on the merits\" of its appeal.\nWhile not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the\nquestion of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel\ndirected that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in\nJuly.\nThe decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least\ntemporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which\nmaintains and controls power transmissions.\nIt gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any\nof its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers.\n\"It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change\nanything over the weekend,\" said Detmers. \"But if Reliant decided on a\nunilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely\ncould have a system emergency.\"\nReliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but\ndeclined to specify their next move.\n\"Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California,\" said company\nlobbyist Marty Wilson, and \"is still of a mind to want to cooperate.\"\nWithout further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District\nCourt decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co.,\nalleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and\nproduction of electricity.\nThe judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of\ninterstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\nHe ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales\ninto federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order,\nand that goes directly to an appellate court.\nThe lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two\nother generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though\nthe agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly\nin debt.\nBecause Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay\ntheir bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to\nthe utilities.\nThe other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston\nand Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing &\nTrading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue\nsupplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to\nsell to companies that are not creditworthy.\nBut Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can\nrescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice.\n\"My hope is this is a temporary setback,\" said Robinson. He added, however,\nthat the practical effect is \"at least for now, we don't have a tool to\ncompel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do\" -- respond to\nemergency demands for power.\nReliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no\njurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators\nand the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must\nsettle any disputes about terms of those tariffs.\nIn issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special\nexpertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO.\n\"Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court\nagrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper,\" he\nsaid. \"But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short\nsupply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at\nrisk.\"\nImmediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for\nthe ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend\nthe suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its\nview that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has\njurisdiction.\nDamrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday.\nIn a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for\nenergy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big\nutilities and sell its power on the open market.\nTimber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants\nthat produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in\nSacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell\nits power to PG&E.\nThe ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative\nenergy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell\ntheir comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state.",

    "body": "As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.\n\nEven though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.\n\nIn addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.\n\nIf you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

    "date": "Thu, 3 May 2001 13:28:00 -0700 (PDT)",
    "body": "Senators Dunn and Bower and their staffs met with representatives of\nMirant, Wiiliams, Duke, Reliant, and Dynegy- and me- for over two hours at\nthe State Capital yesterday. I will report fully on the meeting by telephone\ntomorrow morning, however, this report summarizes the principal issues\ncovered in the session.\nDunn spent about a half hour describing the scope of his\nsub-committee's investigation. He styled it as an investigation into whether\nanti-competitive behavior has occurred or is occurring in the California\nwholesale market. If they find that it has, they will recommend curative\nlegislation. If they find the behavior was criminal they will refer evidence\nto the AG. Dun vowed that he would not allow parties adverse to the\ngenerators to participate in this investigation. At the same time he is\ninviting other county and state lawyers to help him- the first volunteer is\nthe San Joaquin District Attorney. He said there was no predetermined\nconclusion and he would allow the generators to explain the \"suspicious\"\nfacts. He said the investigation would be fair and that if there was a leak\nof information we should \"let him know\". He had two initial requests- first,\nhe wants immediate production of Enron's document retention (he actually\ncalled it document destruction) policy. We are to let him know by Wednesday\nif we will produce the current version. Second, he wants the parties to\nstipulate to an order pledging that each will not destroy documents. He says\nhe will go to court to get such an order if we refuse.\nThe rest of the meeting was spent negotiating a confidentiality\norder. The generators had earlier sent sub-committee special counsel, Larry\nDrivan,  a discussion draft of such an order. Dunn and Drivan discussed it\npoint by point. At the onset Drivan acknowledged Enron had not seen the\ndraft and said nothing said at the meeting would bind Enron to any position\nabout it. The generators and Dunn seemed to agree on many of the principal\npoints- e.g. they would in fact consent to such an order; the subcommittee\ncould contest claims of confidentiality; the subcommittee could require the\nlogging of privileged documents and the assertion of privilege could be\nchallenged in court; they would all initiate a procedure for a court to sign\nsuch an order and preside over discovery disputes. Surprisingly, most\ngenerators did not object when Dunn suggested Sacramento Superior Court as\nthe proper venue-although there was no final agreement on this. The dispute\nbetween the committee and the generators was primarily over who could view\n\"confidential\" documents. The generators wanted NDA's signed by all staff,\nas well as all consultants and experts. Dunn refused.\nLast week the subcommittee subpoenaed the ISO for documents that\npertain to ISO conclusions of market manipulation. The ISO has refused to\nallow the generators or Enron see the documents they will produce. The\ngenerators have discussed seeking a protective order- venue uncertain- but\nDunn (and most of the generators) seemed to believe the stipulated\nconfidentiality order under discussion would solve the problem of ISO\nproduction. Duke asked Dunn to delay the production date for ISO for a few\ndays until they can work out the terms of the confidentiality order. Duke\n(per Kleinman) is in charge of drafting the order. Kleinman said he would\nget a draft to Dunn early next week. Dunn said he had no objection if the\ngenerators got documents from ISO. He asked that the generators call ISO\ndirectly and see if ISO would give the documents to them. Several generators\nsaid they would do that.\n\nThe meeting was maintained at a very professional level. Dunn's\napproach was one of a class action lawyer in a roomful of big corporate\ndefendants- urging everyone to get along because as \"professionals\" everyone\nknew how the game gets played. However, he is seriously understaffed. He has\nfew resources for litigation- nor has he resources to review the millions of\ndocuments he has requested. He must be relying on either outside experts- or\noutside allies- to do that. Given that, it is hard to see how a\nconfidentiality order could be enforced against him, regardless of what he\nstaff discloses. Further,` if he uses outside experts to do who are not\nbound by the order they will likely go to work against us later with the\ninformation. The generators already have made considerable productions to\nthe AG and they may be less troubled by this. They certainly seemed willing\nto play ball at the meeting- although privately they may have other plans\nwhich they did not air with Dunn. We should talk to them about that.\n\n=======================================================\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may\ncontain confidential and privileged information.

We should\ndisseminate this information to the direct access coalition, particularly\nthe Treasurer's statement, and use it to advocate the Comm.

Among other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - which we are actively doing.  As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal - and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below investment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch.\n\nIn response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy businesses.  At the same time, we are nearing the completion of the business review process announced last week.  Once this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructuring of our business.  Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the sale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost saving plan, including layoffs.\n\nWe are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future success, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties.  This must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of Enron.\n\nI know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you.  Although, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this fight and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing businesses of Enron.  All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each other, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we work to overcome these latest challenges.\n\nEven six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be where we are today.  We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company.  As always, I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make.  Thank you.\n\nKen",

    "date": "Tue, 14 Nov 2000 01:33:00 -0800 (PST)",
    "body": "Just to pile on with the issues, I will add a few thoughts of my own for\nissues that we might want to consider in our November 20 comments.\nRe: the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO, Commissioner Massey\nis not totally on board.  He specifically asked about capping the forward\nmarket.  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing\nthat there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24\nmonths) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage\nof their needs from this contract.\nA staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market\n(presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that\ngeneration not be cancelled in California.\nDynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the\nCommission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.  Specifically, what\nis opportunity cost?  As long as the test is not known until after the fact,\nthere will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater\nincentive to sell elsewhere.\nHobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not\neliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be\ntemporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues\nand retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be\nonly for one month).\nMany, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission\nshould not institute penalties only on the load.  They claimed this was\none-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied\nto the supply side as well.  They also argued that the load could not meet\nthe 5% test.\nMassey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's\nencouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their\nauthority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.\nLarcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation\nbefore deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of\ntoday.  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include\nstranded costs.\nThere was almost no support for the single price auction in California.\nThe California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be\nchanged, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.  A\nCourt battle was threatened.\n\n\n\n\nSteven J Kean\n11/13/2000 08:51 AM\n\nTo: Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J\nMara/SFO/EES@EES, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sarah\nNovosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Paul\nKaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT\nSubject: Re: Comments on FERC November 1 order\n\nThere are a few other issues we need to look into:\n\nLarcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the\nprice caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO\n-- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked\nif knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I\nsuspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as\nthe market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this\n\"exemption\" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it\nthrough.  Is EOL or APX an alternative?\nMassey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.\nSpecifically, \"has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market\ndevelopment?\"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we\nshould argue that \"PJMing\" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder\nforward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that\ntake away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about\ncontracting forward.\nWe have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think\nthrough whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take\nthe approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to\nprovide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those\nrequirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as\nmuch as possible).\nFinally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO\nas a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO\nis simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in\nretaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing\ntheir lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices,\nacquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial\nand highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.\n\n\n\nMary Hain@ECT\n11/10/2000 11:13 AM\n\nTo: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron\ncc:\nSubject: Comments on FERC November 1 order\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Hain/HOU/ECT on 11/10/2000 09:20 AM\n---------------------------\n________________________\n\n\nTo: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT, steve.c.hall@enron.com, Richard Sanders,\nSusan J Mara/SFO/EES@EES, Mona L Petrochko/NA/Enron@Enron,\njdasovic@ees.enron.com, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, James D\nSteffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hartsoe@Enron, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON,\nJames E Keller/HOU/EES@EES, Mike D Smith/HOU/EES@EES, Harry\nKingerski/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert\nBadeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Steve\nKean, Richard Shapiro, Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT\ncc: carrrn@bracepatt.com, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com\nFrom: Mary Hain/HOU/ECT\nDate: 11/09/2000 05:19:03 PM\nSubject: Comments on FERC November 1 order\n\nFor purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of\nissues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our\ncomments to FERC.

I have noted in paragraph 6(h) (and the same\ncomments applies to paragraph 6(i)) that I need further explanation of the\nprovision itself, and I will be happy to discuss this provision with\nsomeone from Enron or someone in our shop.\n\nFor the most part, the agreement looks pretty good.  Most of my changes\nfocused on the arbitration clause.  Given the nature of this Agreement, we\nshould be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for\nexample, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron\nEnergy Services).  If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we\nmay want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and\nDynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an\nexhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect\nat the time this Netting Agreement is executed.\n\nPlease contact me with any questions or comments you may have.\n\nThanks.\n\nErnie\n\n(See attached file: Enron Master Netting Revised 10-23-01.doc)\n\n\n\n- Netout.doc\n- Enron Master Netting Revised 10-23-01.doc",
